He is an effective villain because he has been booked to be unstoppable — all to better set up the moment when he is stopped .

# ::tok " The Core of an Onion , ” Mark Kurlansky’s latest single - subject food book , made me think of Thanksgiving . He devotes an entire chapter to creamed onions , essential at Thanksgiving dinner when I was growing up . His book has recipes for them dated to 1665 and a reference to the 1941 film " They Died With Their Boots On , ” in which the onions play a role alongside Errol Flynn . Other discussions of onion cookery — as in soup , stuffed , fried , breads , pickled , with eggs , in sandwiches ( famously by James Beard ) and more , with recipe histories — follow an unraveling of the onion botanically , historically , medicinally , literally , economically and gastronomically around the world . Despite relevant but overlong digressions on the origins of the Gibson and of the bagel , it’s a lively read . On the culinary side he might have touched on the Spanish tortilla when discussing eggs and onions ; he makes an interesting point about swapping cream for milk when using older recipes .

# ::tok This week , I called Dr . Izzeldin Abuelaish , a physician from Gaza who now lives in Canada , to check in on him . During Israel’s 2008-9 war on Gaza , three of his daughters were killed when an Israeli tank struck their home . This time , I had to offer my condolences again , when he told me about the recent deaths of more than 25 members of his extended family in Gaza . Among them , he said , were five babies .

But sometimes it feels like the real reason that I run is to get better at running . I run so that I can run more .

# ::tok The Supreme Court is considering whether to take up the question of presidential immunity — that is , the idea that a president , by virtue of the unique nature of the office , is entitled to exceedingly broad protections from legal consequences for statements made and actions taken while in office . If the court takes up that question in a case regarding Donald Trump , it will have profound consequences for both the 2024 election and the bigger question of presidential power .

# ::tok After a long day at work , I absent - mindedly boarded an express train .

Sitting on that last train to my apartment , I felt a digital dreariness overcome me . I’d spent all day responding to emails , Slacks and DMs . I just wanted to not look at a screen . I didn’t have a book with me , so I took out my notebook and jotted down everything I saw , heard or smelled : A backpack occupying a seat for a human . A woman wearing a spiky hat . Shoelaces , untied . Shoelaces , tied . An aggressively yellow ad for something called Mullvad . " Do Not Lean on Door . ” Snoring . The person next to me typing out in a text , " Dinner next week ? ” before quickly deleting it and locking his phone .

# ::tok In the 1970 s and ’80s , when Rainer Judd was growing up at 101 Spring Street in New York’s SoHo with her father , the artist Donald Judd , she’d sit in the building’s open windows , " because no one told me not to , ” she said , and because back then , SoHo was a " creaky , dirty , lovely place . ” In 1971 , her father wrote that one day , the neighborhood might be invaded by " tourist shops and restaurants , bad art and high rents . ” And while this premonition has largely come to pass , his home , a cast - iron former textile factory where his family — which also included his wife , the dancer Julie Finch , and his son , Flavin — lived according to Judd’s influential ideas about art and architecture , is almost entirely unchanged .

# ::tok I first heard the band Sleater - Kinney when I was a teenager , and it’s not an exaggeration to say it changed my life . The early 2000 s were a particularly macho time in rock music — all wounded emo boys and nü - metal aggressors — and even in the late ’90s it was difficult to find female musicians lauded for how well they played their instruments rather than the way they looked . Then I happened upon a live recording of Sleater - Kinney playing its 1997 song " Words and Guitar , ” and it blew my hair back like I’d entered a wind tunnel .

This latter experience happened as I looked into the growing bureaucratization of American life . It’s not only that growing bureaucracies cost a lot of money ; they also enervate American society . They redistribute power from workers to rule makers , and in so doing sap initiative , discretion , creativity and drive .

# ::tok My mother and I disagree on a lot , but we often put our disagreements aside to enjoy a healthier relationship , even if it’s on a surface level . She has been anti - abortion my entire life . We now live on opposite sides of the country and see each other maybe twice a year . When she visits , she often speaks of abortion as murder ; her tone is visceral . She is very aware of my pro - choice beliefs , but she does not know that I have had two abortions ( neither of which I regret ) . I am in my 30s , and each passing year my desire to be a mother decreases exponentially . Recently , she has begun to complain about her lack of grandchildren . I have chosen not to tell her about my abortions , because this information might be grief - inducing for her . But as she continues to push her ideologies on me , I feel more and more compelled to share my life experiences and choices . What do I owe her ? — Name Withheld

# ::tok A couple of weeks ago , a young crowd in Shanghai came out in force to celebrate Halloween . The street where I live filled with revelers dressed in a range of elaborate costumes — as the white - clad enforcers of China’s Covid lockdowns , as Chinese courtesans or simply as a watermelon . Halloween allows us to dress up as something that we can’t otherwise be . It’s a strong impulse right now in China , which remains stuck in a postpandemic malaise marked by job shortages , a trend of disillusioned 20 - somethings dropping out of the work force and society and a general yearning for a different way to be .

# ::tok A few blocks from where the Cronut was born , a new pastry mash - up by a French chef is making its debut . Gregory Doyen developed a cakelike confection inspired by brownies and cookies that’s round , about three inches in diameter , fairly dense and with a central opening where a ganache or fruit filling goes . Mr. Doyen is calling it MOD , for multilayered original dessert . It’s offered as a single serving ( $ 7.50 each ) and in fours ( $29 ) , and can be shared and personalized . In a show of extreme confidence , it’s the only product sold in the bright white shop of the same name he owns with Edward Geyman , his business partner . A native of the Burgundy region in France who studied pastry - making and has been a pastry consultant in many countries around the globe , Mr. Doyen , 38 , arrived in the United States a year ago and began working on this project . " I didn’t just want to reproduce French pastry , ” he said . The flavor and filling combinations are endless . For now he has eight colorful examples , including peanut butter and jelly , matcha with white chocolate , walnut with dark chocolate , red velvet with dark chocolate and raspberry , and pecan caramel with milk chocolate chips and sea salt . He has a featured flavor of the month , which for now is s’mores with a marshmallow topping that he torches before serving . He said he’s working on a mini size .

# ::tok It will be a long time before any of us understand what happened after Oct. 7 , but it seems important first to recognize how news of everything comes to us today . Newspaper headlines aren’t fixed — they change over the course of a day ; social media presents tragedies in fragmented shards , which are then contested and rejected and reaffirmed ; television news , especially on foreign affairs , remains too hyper and flashy to take seriously . Every single one of us had our own individualized experience of that day and the days after it . No one can confidently say who knew what when .

# ::tok Trader Joe’s , West Hollywood . " Your total is $ 20.69 , ” announces the cashier at my register . Seconds later , the cashier at the next register over says to a male customer , " Your total is $ 20.69 . ” Wait , what ? The staff whoops . Someone says , " No way ! ” He and I grin sloppily in the sudden spotlight , paired so arbitrarily by groceries . Bystander : " It’s a rom - com opening , baby ! ” The other $ 20.69 meets my eyes , testing gently for truth in that idea . For a moment , I entertain another universe — one where I’m not gay — and smile wide . Then I say , " Good night . ” — Zoe Marie Bel

# ::tok During the difficult months of 2020 , a writer friend and I decided to read Willa Cather’s fiction together . What a good antidote to despair that was . Much of it was rereading , but I’d missed some stories and novels , and I’d never read them sequentially or with a clear sense of Cather’s life . That spring I also delved into several of the biographies , which taught me something about how such books can vary .

# ::tok My wife became pregnant soon after we met , when our relationship was " fluid” and non - monogamous . We agreed to raise the child together and , at my urging , to have an open relationship . However , our relationship since has been monogamous . My wife was injured during the birth of our second child and now finds sex painful and avoids it . ( We had a terrific sex life before the injury . ) When I broached the topic of having other partners and reminded her of our agreement to have an open relationship , she became irritated and said that having kids changed things . Subsequent discussions resulted in a stalemate .

# ::tok " It all began with writing , ” goes the first line of Adam Thirlwell’s latest novel , in which a young socialite named Celine is slandered in pornographic , anonymously authored pamphlets circulating in prerevolutionary Paris . Four pages later , Thirlwell clears his throat — actually , Celine’s publicity troubles go back to the Big Bang : " The universe disintegrates into a cloud of heat , it falls inevitably into a vortex of entropy , but within this irreversible process there may be areas of order , portions of existence that tend toward a form , in which it might be possible to discern a design — and one of these was this story of Celine and her friends . ” This could have gone without saying , but Thirlwell can’t help himself . In " The Future Future , ” the English writer compulsively gestures to the biggest picture and decides it’s the gesture that’s profound .

# ::tok Q : I live in a co - op apartment on the Upper West Side . There is a rent - stabilized apartment on my floor occupied by an older couple who have lived here for 50 years and have serious health issues . This morning , one of the occupants , who has advanced dementia , opened my apartment door , which was briefly unlocked , and was standing in my living room ! I was able to gently escort her back to her apartment . Building management said that they have spoken to the city’s adult protective services , which has investigated and declined to act . This is a terrible situation — there are no interested family members , and the couple is often unbathed and walking the halls . What can we do ?

# ::tok Apparently , some time in 1964 , a professional ice skater and animal trainer named Dave Pitts , on the road with his chimp Spanky , picked up a young hitchhiker who was in the middle of a killing spree . The story of Pitts’s encounter with Larry Lee Ranes , whose brother also became a serial killer , was fictionalized in Conrad Hilberry’s book " Luke Karamazov . ” That book is the source of " He Went That Way , ” the picturesque feature directing debut of the cinematographer Jeff Darling , who died in a surfing accident in 2022 .

# ::tok " Kevin Hart & Chris Rock : Headliners Only , ” a slick , self - mythologizing piece of Netflix content that follows the two comedians on the recent arena shows they teamed up on , is aimed at comedy fans — even if much of it will be familiar to them . The story of how Eddie Murphy spotted Rock at The Comic Strip ( now Comic Strip Live ) and offered him a job on the sequel to " Beverly Hills Cop” has been told many times . And any stand - up fan on social media knows that Hart presented a goat to Rock at the end of their recent show at Madison Square Garden ( as well as whether or not Dave Chappelle would show up ) . That doesn’t mean there aren’t reasons to watch .

The album begins with loops of laughter and ethereal oohs and ahs ; it ends with Uchis thanking listeners with a " mwah” kiss . It’s an album of breezy confidence and sly ingenuity , easily moving among futuristic electronics , 1990 s nostalgia and Latin roots .

# ::tok Born in Mulhouse , France , in 1907 , Jean Schlumberger was constantly sketching as a child . He dreamed of becoming an artist one day , but his parents , who hoped he’d take over the family textile business , sent him to Berlin to practice banking instead . In his early 20s , he defiantly moved to Paris and opened a jewelry workshop on Rue La Boétie , where he handcrafted delicate floral brooches out of Meissen porcelain , antique cameos and decorative Victorian objects he found at the Marché aux Puces . His fantastical creations soon captured the attention of the fashion world . After spotting Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark in a pair of his earrings in 1937 , the Italian couturier Elsa Schiaparelli commissioned him to design buttons shaped like fruits and insects .

# ::tok Caboodle was a sweet but average cat . Not especially beautiful , intelligent , affectionate or agile , she lived a long , happy , uneventful life . When she died in September 1999 , my husband and I buried her under a rose bush in our backyard . That October , the month of my 50th birthday and long after the last rose had faded , a single bloom emerged . For about 10 years after Caboodle’s death , a single rose would bloom in mid - October . Pretty extraordinary , for an average cat . — Judith Karp

# ::tok Fifty years ago last month , Erica Jong published a debut novel that went on to sell more than 20 million copies . " Fear of Flying , ” a book so sexually frank that you may have found it hidden in your mother’s underwear drawer , broke new ground in the explicitness of writing by and for women . Jong’s heroine , Isadora Wing , was a live wire . She was also a dead end , certainly for Jong , and maybe for feminism , too .

# ::tok At the risk of evoking unpleasant memories of high - school English , can we please discuss the word allegory ? It refers to a story or a painting that comes with a moral or a lesson , perhaps a social or political one . And , in an era when figurative art has returned to prominence , the New York galleries are filled with a profusion of both allegorical paintings and their very opposite — which is to say , paintings that reject third - person narration in favor of first - person self - exposure . I caught two shows last week — Dana Schutz’s and Tracey Emin’s — that represent the two extremes .

# ::tok A demonstration last week involving butchering half an heirloom pig , and showing how to use various parts , kicked off a series in the basement workshop and bakery at Leland Eating and Drinking House in Prospect Heights , Brooklyn . It was followed by a five - course tasting dinner in the wine cellar , starring pork . The restaurant , which does its own butchering as a matter of course , has scheduled subsequent classes monthly throughout the year , with the next one on Feb. 21 , followed by March 13 , both pork - centric . Later in the year there will be sessions about duck and fish . The classes and dinners , starting at 6 p . m. , are $ 100 plus tax , tip and beverages .

In the introduction to her new collection , NIGHT SIDE OF THE RIVER : Ghost Stories ( Grove , 306 pp . , $27 ) , she recalls some of her own inexplicable experiences with the uncanny , from the ghost of a writer friend materializing on her computer screen to her childhood premonition of her grandmother’s passing . Religion , and specifically faith in an afterlife , " can be considered as humankind’s first disruptive start - up , ” she writes . " What’s being disrupted is death . ”

# ::tok On a Cape Cod beach last January , I braced for my daily cold water plunge . " Can I join you ? ” asked a stranger . I hesitated . But her red hair and wide smile reminded me of my younger self . " Sure , ” I said . Ashley is 29 . I’m 47 . For seven minutes in frigid water , we shared our stories : her chronic illness and career change ; my failed marriage and struggles raising a child with cancer . Every day since our first encounter , we’ve met to immerse ourselves in the ocean . We bond in a daily baptism . I now can’t imagine braving water , or life , without her . — Amy McHugh

# ::tok Michael Bennett , the former N.F.L. player , started designing furniture as a way to reconsider architecture and the spaces that Black people occupy . Inspired by his upbringing in Louisiana and Texas , as well as by trips to Senegal , where his ancestors are from , Bennett began to think about the objects that " bring Black people together in public spaces” as a way to deepen his longtime activism work focused on racial justice . After retiring from football in 2020 , he founded the design practice Studio Kër . Bennett’s exploration of the Black home led him to create an 11 - piece collection of sculptural furniture that he’s debuting this month in " We Gotta Get Back to the Crib , ” his inaugural exhibition for the Los Angeles art gallery Marta , presented at Theaster Gates’s Rebuild Foundation in Chicago . ( In the spring , the show will travel to Houston . ) The collection reimagines objects of communal gatherings ; pieces include the Gumbo lounge chair , a lush take on the stackable monobloc chair , and the Pew couch , a nod to the church bench , made of leather and ekki wood . " For me , the show is about celebrating Black ingenuity and connecting back to that African diasporic design language , ” says Bennett . " We Gotta Get Back to the Crib” is on view from Jan. 12 through Feb. 10 , marta . la .

# ::tok We know — 2023 isn’t over yet . There are still many holiday parties and cookie swaps and family dinners to barrel through . But these recipes have been such major hits with our readers that we figure we’re good to share them now . For that holiday party , how about roasted cauliflower with crispy Parmesan , which works as either a crowd - pleasing veggie side or part of an appetizer spread ? For the cookie swap , you’ll want to refer to our 2023 Cookie Week recipes , but any sweet treat would be perfect paired with a bubbly tinto de verano . ( Yes , summer is in the drink’s name , but this refreshing mix of red wine and citrus soda is delightful year - round . ) And you have several options for that family dinner : white chicken chili ( above ) , shrimp tacos or this perfect eggplant Parmesan that’s already dressed in red and green .

# ::tok Modestly scaled and tonally perfect , " Fallen Leaves” opens in a fluorescent hell - on - earth and ends with a vision of something like paradise . In between , there are lonely nights , fleeting joys , ordinary degradations , laborious work , karaoke reveries , many cigarettes and more drinks . A lot of the drinks are downed hurriedly and often furtively by a man , while elsewhere a woman listens to sad songs . Outwardly , these two are leading lives of quiet desperation , though because this is an Aki Kaurismaki movie , their despair comes with great comic timing .

# ::tok The origin of this seasonal slasher is in an ersatz trailer the horror filmmaker Eli Roth made for the portmanteau movie " Grindhouse” in 2007 . The two lurid features directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino were separated by a series of teasers for imaginary movies concocted by like - minded pals of the filmmakers , also including Rob Zombie and Edgar Wright . Believe it or not , Roth’s feature - length version of " Thanksgiving” is the third such trailer to get its Pinocchio - esque re al-movie wish .

# ::tok When people ask me what my favorite horror movie is , John Carpenter’s groundbreaking shocker comes out on top . Jamie Lee Curtis plays a high schooler who gets stalked on Halloween night by an escaped lunatic named Michael Myers . Today it sounds like any old horror movie . But Carpenter was prophetic with narrative choices that horror now takes for granted : a masked killing - machine villain , a strong - willed final girl next door , creatively depicted deaths , touches of dark comedy . ( And a score that sounds like a chase . ) Together they make " Halloween” my top Halloween treat .

# ::tok Poetry makes nothing happen , W.H. Auden said in 1939 , when words must have seemed especially impotent ; but cinema is another matter . For several decades after the end of the Second World War , what’s come to be seen as its central catastrophe — the near - total destruction of the European Jews — was consigned to the status of a footnote . The neglect was rooted in guilt : Many nations eagerly collaborated in the killing , while others did nothing to prevent it . Consumed by their own suffering , most people simply didn’t want to know , and a conspiracy of silence was established .

# ::tok Until 2011 , conscription was mandatory for German men , with the option to refuse armed service and do civil service at home or abroad instead . In 2009 at age 19 , I chose to go abroad as part of a development aid program , hoping that I would have the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to a community . I went to Senegal for a one - year civil service assignment for a German nongovernmental organization that I picked from a list of options provided by a ministry’s website .

# ::tok Q : We live on the first and second floors of a brownstone in East Harlem , and we love the backyard . Two buildings over , a neighbor in the second - floor apartment has put a litter box on the fire escape outside their window for community cats to shelter . The neighbor also puts out food for them . In the morning , there are usually half a dozen adult cats lingering around the box and the stairs . Inevitably , they end up roaming in our backyard , peeing , pooping and fighting . The odor in the summer is terrible . We’ve had two female cats give birth in our backyard this year alone . The kittens are cute , their cries not so much . What can we do ?

# ::tok Have you ever spent quality time with a chicken ? I raised them as a teenager , and I do not particularly recommend it . They can be smelly and dirty . They’re honestly not very bright . Yet they’re like living cartoons , weird and funny to watch , with spindly little legs holding up plump little bodies . They cluck disapprovingly when you take their eggs , and they’ll eat anything you dump in their yard ( including , uh , chicken ) .

# ::tok A change taking place right now has the potential to do more good within U.S. prisons than any policy in a generation — good that will extend far beyond the realm of criminal justice . With a 2020 law finally taking full effect , people who are incarcerated can for the first time in decades get Pell Grants , the federal tuition aid for low - income students . The grants are small , but they are critical to rebuilding one of the most important tools we have to reduce crime and mitigate the harms of mass incarceration : college education .

# ::tok Some new restaurants are opportunistic , the result of circumstance . Others , like the Danish chef Mads Refslund’s new Brooklyn project , are years in the planning — eight years exactly , said Mr. Refslund , a founder of Noma in Copenhagen . What he set out to achieve is a fluid fine - dining concept , where the cooks are the servers . " Everyone is a cook , ” he said . " They can best explain the food to the customers , but turning cooks into waiters is a challenge . ” There are 26 of them , all dressed in black and rotating their stations . They’re in full view at work : The dining room amounts to a huge square kitchen , surrounded by 58 counter and table seats , and a bar and a lounge in an industrial space — previously a rubber factory — with a white brick 1930 s facade . The restaurant’s menu lists ingredients , each of which can be ordered , in consultation with a cook / waiter , hot or cold , grilled or chilled , or , as the name has it , fire ( ild in Danish ) and ice ( is ) . The only meat options are sustainable American bison and venison . Custom carts bearing produce and seafood snacks to start a meal ( priced per item ) patrol the dining area . The menu is à la carte with a minimum of five dishes per person ( $ 150 ) ; some are served family - style . The 18 - seat bar also serves food with no minimum requirement . Among the dishes devised by Mr. Refslund and Bryce Shuman , his chef de cuisine ( who knows his way around a grill if his food at Sweetbriar , his previous gig , is any indication ) , are Shigoku oysters with green almonds and cucumber , venison tartare wrapped in beet rosettes , tuna lightly roasted on kombu , grilled wild duck with plum juice , grilled sea scallop dumplings , surf clam shells sealed to form a vessel and filled with clam and tomato water to drink , and smoked barbecued eel . On Sundays , meals are served family style , starting at noon , no reservations . ( Opens Wednesday )

# ::tok The first several minutes of Adrian Murray’s cringe comedy take place in a single , uninterrupted shot . Framed from behind , Molly ( Molly Reisman ) , a 20 - something woman in Toronto , and her new housemate , wait in a car by the side of the road as a cop issues Molly a ticket for reckless driving . Even as the film eventually moves on to multiple other locations , including Molly’s apartment , her office and her ex - boyfriend’s home , we never truly leave those initial minutes in the car . The incident takes over Molly’s entire life as she becomes increasingly obsessed with fighting the ticket — re - enacting the scenario repeatedly , doing the rounds of traffic court and talking her friends’ and co - workers’ ears off about the wrongs of the system .

# ::tok Vajra Chandrasekera’s THE SAINT OF BRIGHT DOORS ( Tordotcom , 356 pp . , $ 27.99 ) is the best book I’ve read this year . Fetter , the protagonist , is one of several almost - chosen - ones who have shirked or sidestepped their spectacular destinies in favor of haunted and marginal lives in the city of Luriat . The city has many " bright doors” that seem to open onto nothing . Fetter’s fascination with them draws him into a web of Luriati intrigue involving his estranged and godlike father , the Perfect and Kind — whom Fetter has been trained since childhood to kill .

# ::tok Before the war ( the First World War , I mean ; with so many wars one can lose count ) , Max Beckmann was painting clean , traditionalist self - portraits and lush pictures of bathers by the sea . He was a neoconservative with no time for Matisse or Picasso , and certainly no interest in the coming of abstraction . Then , when the war broke out , the artist volunteered for the medical corps of the Imperial German Army . He got posted to Flanders , where he witnessed the murderous , meaningless second Battle of Ypres . He sketched the Belgian landscape , and the doctors and orderlies .

# ::tok Not without reason has modeling been termed the ugly business of being beautiful . Opaque , barely regulated and often cutthroat , it is seldom viewed as an incubator of big - hearted altruists . Yet when news came this week that Ivan Bart , the former president of IMG models , died suddenly at age 60 — following what was described as a brief illness — social media lit up with outpourings of praise for a man that Fern Mallis , a seasoned industry consultant and the author of " Fashion Lives : Fashion Icons with Fern Mallis , ” called " one of the most delicious human beings you ever want to know . ”

# ::tok Ava DuVernay’s " Origin” is as audacious as it is ambitious . At its core , it concerns an intellectual argument about history and hierarchies of power , but it’s also about the fraught process of making this argument . It’s a daunting conceit that DuVernay has shaped into an eventful narrative that is , by turns , specific and far - ranging , diagnostic and aspirational . It is a great big swing about taking a great big swing , and while the film is more persuasive as a drama than the argument it relays , few American movies this year reach so high so boldly .

# ::tok In the award - winning Indian picture book " A Walk With Thambi” ( 2017 ) , written by Lavanya Karthik and illustrated by Proiti Roy , a boy named Thambi enjoys a late - afternoon stroll with his dog . The art shows the dog in the lead and Thambi holding a white stick with a red tip , but the narrative never mentions that Thambi is blind . Instead , we follow along as the pair listen to street sounds , smell the bazaar , feel the breeze and play with friends . When they realize it’s sunset and past their curfew , they race home , eyes wide and legs ( and stick ) akimbo . Thambi’s mother takes in the muddy duo and finally , humorously , it is revealed that her son is blind .

# ::tok I was born in February 1998 in Tuba , a rural shepherding community of 80 Palestinian residents in the South Hebron Hills of the West Bank , where my family has lived for generations . Over the years we have suffered repeated attacks by Israeli settlers , part of an ongoing campaign to remove us from our land . Still , nothing prepared me for what our life has become since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 . In the last six weeks , the raids and harassment by settlers have become so intense that I do not know how much longer I and the other members of my community will be able to live here .

# ::tok Most of us don’t want to think too much about our hot dogs : what’s in them , how they were made , what " nitrates” really do . In her new audiobook , " Raw Dog , ” the comedian Jamie Loftus bravely rips off the Band - Aid of her own hot dog ignorance . The audiobook is many things : part gonzo travelogue in which Loftus and a boyfriend spend the summer of 2021 traversing the country to sample its dogs ; part cultural analysis of the tube meat as American icon ; part takedown of the factory farming system ; part memoir about a crumbling relationship straining under the weight of cheap motel rooms and indigestion .

We are publishing it at the end of a year in which loneliness started getting the kind of attention it has long deserved — an effort led , in large part , by the surgeon general of the United States , Dr . Vivek Murthy . In a guest essay last spring , he revealed that he , too , had struggled with loneliness and said the nation was facing " an epidemic of loneliness and isolation . ” Several days later , he issued a surgeon general advisory about the problem , calling it a " public health crisis” and outlining a strategy to confront it .

Hundreds of outdated monitors are arranged beside money trees and waving maneki neko cats , an installation in a kind of mini - museum run by CTL’s proprietor , Chi - Tien Lui , who has worked as a TV and radio repairman since immigrating from Taiwan in 1961 . At CTL , which he opened in 1968 , Lui initially sold closed - circuit TV systems and video equipment , but for the past couple of decades , his business has had a unique focus : repairing video artworks that , since the onset of the digital age , are increasingly likely to malfunction and decay .

# ::tok In 1996 , in a phrase that’s stuck with me , Richard John Neuhaus described the Holocaust as " our only culturally available icon of absolute evil . ” The line appeared in a critical review of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen’s best - selling and furor - starting book , " Hitler’s Willing Executioners , ” which was itself an example of Neuhaus’s point in action . In the post - Cold War landscape , with American power seemingly occupying the stage of history by itself , the memory of Nazi Germany’s genocide came to play a special cultural role in the self - understanding of the liberal West : We might not agree on the highest good , but we knew the highest evil , and arguments about its memory and meaning and implications were absolutely central to politics and culture .

# ::tok Less than a week after presenting his third collection as Ferragamo’s creative director in Milan this past September , Maximilian Davis was at ease . The clothes — a luxurious combination of asymmetrical dresses and Italian tailoring — had been well received . As he spoke , quietly but with confidence , he gestured gently with his hands , like a conductor keeping an unhurried tempo . Born in Manchester , England , to Trinidadian and Jamaican parents , Davis , 28 , the youngest of three children , spent his summers in Trinidad until the age of 13 . A passion for clothing ran in the family : His maternal grandmother taught him to sew when he was 6 , his mother was a working model and his father studied fashion design .

# ::tok As Holly , the protagonist of Elizabeth Hand’s " A Haunting on the Hill , ” approaches an imposing , deserted mansion tucked off a remote country road , she drives past a tree stump that’s " choked with poison ivy , a riot of scarlet leaves and white berries . ” Though she doesn’t know it yet , the tree that once stood there claimed the life of Eleanor Vance , the tragic lead from the novel’s antecedent text , Shirley Jackson’s wildly influential " The Haunting of Hill House . ” And so , a couple dozen pages into the book , Hand makes her first decisive mark on Jackson’s landscape , acknowledging her predecessor while making the house her own . When Jackson left Hill House , the tree was still standing . Hand is here to chop it down .

# ::tok How do you sift through Mexico City’s roughly 57,000 places to eat — more than twice as many as there are in New York City — and choose the most essential dishes ? " In a city like Mexico City , how do you narrow it down ? It’s insane . The exercise is absurd to begin with , ” says Gabriela Cámara , the chef and owner of Contramar and three other restaurants in the Mexican capital , at the outset of the video conversation I’d arranged to do just that : identify the specific meals or bites ( or drinks ) that best represent the metropolis’s formidable food scene right now . Nonetheless , Cámara was up for the challenge , as were the four other panelists I’d convened , all of whom live in Mexico City either year - round or part time : Ana Dolores , the chef and owner of Esquina Común restaurant in the Condesa neighborhood ; Anais Martinez , who founded the Curious Mexican , a street - food tour company , and recently opened Manada , an all - Mexican cocktail and natural wine bar in Narvarte ; the food writer Alonso Ruvalcaba , the author of the guide " 24 Horas de Comida en la Ciudad de México” ( 2018 ) ; and Carla Valdivia Nakatani , T Magazine’s art director , who splits her time between Manhattan and Mexico City , where she co - owns a boutique in Roma . Before we met as a group , I’d asked each participant to nominate around 10 dishes , including a sweet and a drink , from 10 different spots , ranging from fine - dining restaurants to street carts and market stalls . Then we spent two hours and several subsequent emails and phone calls debating our choices , trying to whittle down the 50 - plus nominations to 25 in order to produce a list like those in the ongoing T 25 series devoted to food in Paris and in New York .

# ::tok And just like that , Ron DeSantis’s quest for the presidency is kaput . In a short video on Sunday , the Florida governor looked natty in a blue suit and red tie , every hair perfectly in place as he papered over his deeply imperfect campaign . He touted his leadership and , perhaps with an eye toward running again in 2028 , endorsed the Republican kingmaker , Donald Trump . It wasn’t a terrible performance , especially under the circumstances . But watching Mr. DeSantis’s now - famous awkward smile and listening to his unnatural cadence , it was hard not to think : Yeah . I can see why this guy’s candidacy is deader than disco .
