Both officers have pleaded not guilty to those charges . But the new filings give details about the attack on the third officer , who has been identified only as Officer John Doe . They also said that the attack occurred after Mr. Epstein’s death and that it was unprovoked . A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on the allegations . [ NYT ]

# ::tok Why run ? I do n't know . Why do people want to jump out of airplanes or go rock climbing ? It 's a thrill , an adventure , a challenge and so much more . For me , it is the way that I feel when I am running . I love being outside in nature . I enjoy feeling my body move as I push myself to see what I can achieve . Running helps me clear my head and be present in the moment . It 's also about connecting with others who share the same passion . The running community is amazing ! They are supportive , encouraging and non - judgmental . I 've met some really great people through running . Most importantly , I have learned so much about myself and what I am capable of by pushing myself physically and mentally

# ::tok Apple resumed sales of its newest smartwatches in Germany after a brief suspension due to a patent dispute . Apple was forced by a German court last week to temporarily stop selling the Apple Watch because of an alleged patent infringement on a product sold by Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group AG . The injunction affected both online and brick - and - mortar sales , but not through third - party retailers . Apple said it would appeal the decision . Apple 's 4G version of the Apple Watch is still banned from sale in Germany .

These suspicions are often based on race and class , as well as gender and sexuality . In fact , over 80 % of those stopped are black or Latino , although only 52 % of New Yorkers are black or Latino . The stops have been especially common for young men of color , like the NYU students .

# ::tok One of the most important lessons that I learned from my time at Y Combinator was how to run a startup . The founders in our batch were very different , but there were certain traits that they all shared . One of these is how well organized their companies were . When we got accepted into YC , our company was already pretty far along . We had raised seed funding and had an office with over 20 people working for us . However , when you look under the hood , it’s amazing how disorganized some startups can be . I saw this firsthand with other companies in our batch who came into YC as just an idea or two people hacking away on something in their dorm room . These founders didn’t have much experience running a business , so naturally there

# ::tok I first heard Sleater Kinney in 2003 , when I was working at a record store in my hometown . The album was One Beat and the song was " Step Aside , ” which I remember playing over and over again on repeat . That song made me realize that there are songs you can’t listen to just once . You have to play them again and again because each time they reveal something new—another layer of meaning , another sound or texture , an emotion you didn’t hear before . That’s why I love music : It never stops surprising you .

# ::tok Once upon a time , the best horror films were considered B - movies . They had minuscule budgets and small casts and crews , but the filmmakers used their lack of resources to their advantage by creating something new and unique . Nowadays , big studios have taken over with bloated blockbusters that are filled with CGI and often miss the mark completely when it comes to scares . These days , horror fans are better off sticking to Netflix for quality genre content . Here 's a list of some of the best horror movies on Netflix right now .

# ::tok Almost everyone on the national political scene in the early 1970 s was a man . Then a city supervisor named Dianne Feinstein decided to run for mayor of San Francisco , and won . When her predecessor was assassinated , she became acting mayor—the first woman to hold the job . And when she ran for a full term as mayor , she won again , by the largest margin in the city 's history . At that time , only one woman had ever been elected governor or U.S. senator ; today there are nine women governors and eighteen women senators . In this video created for the Women and Leadership Archives at Loyola University Chicago , women leaders look back on Feinstein 's historic role , and what it meant for them and their own careers

But the movie is also filled with references to other crime classics like " Reservoir Dogs” and " Se7en . ” It’s a strange concoction that doesn’t always work , but there are some fun moments .

# ::tok David Chang is a pretty good guy . He has a big ego , sure , but he does n't let it get in the way of his work . He 's not afraid to be honest about himself and his business , which is why I think this article by Pete Wells is so interesting . I do n't know that I agree with everything he says , but it definitely makes me consider what he 's saying . The more you read about restaurants and chefs , the more you understand that they are just people like everyone else . They have their flaws , but they also have things that make them great . You can love or hate what they do , but at least you can appreciate how hard they worked to get where they are .

# ::tok It will be interesting to see how this book develops over time . I have read the first edition and it is full of facts , but lacking in interpretation or analysis . The authors are young and may grow into the task . They do not seem to know much about the history of terrorism and its impact on American society from 1960 through the 2000 's . It would be helpful if they had some historical perspective on terrorist attacks before 9/11 .

# ::tok On Christmas Eve 2016 , my daughter and I were invited to a beautiful Christmas dinner in an old farmhouse on the outskirts of town . The meal was delicious , but as we were leaving , one of our hosts said something that caught my attention . He had been cleaning up after dinner and , with his back turned to us , he told us about his childhood growing up in that very house . His father had been a farmer , he explained , and they raised cows , chickens , pigs , sheep and other animals on their property . It was hard work , he recalled , but it taught him responsibility , and his family always made sure there was enough food for everyone who lived there .

# ::tok The president of Harvard University is the chief administrator of the university and the ex officio chairman of the Harvard Corporation . Each president is appointed by and is responsible to the corporation ; in practice , this has meant that since 1672 , presidents have been selected by an influential group within the corporation known as the " board”—made up of the president , treasurer , and five other members—which is self - perpetuating and whose membership is kept secret . The first president was Henry Dunster ; the current president , Drew Gilpin Faust , announced in February 2018 that she would step down at the end of June 2018 . She will be succeeded on July 1 , 2018 by Lawrence Bacow .

# ::tok The word congenial has been around in English since at least 1580 . It comes from the Latin word congenium , which means " born with , ” and its original meaning was " born together . ” In English it came to mean " agreeable” or " suitable . ” A person who is agreeable is someone whose company you enjoy ; a suitable person is one who fits well into his or her surroundings . If something is suitable for an occasion , then it’s appropriate for that particular time and place .

They are holding out for bigger sales before they buy — or simply not buying at all unless it is at a steep markdown . The result has been one of the longest and most pronounced declines in retail prices since the 1930 s , leaving stores struggling with flat or lower sales .

It literally eats the heart out of its host , leaving it with no choice but to die . The newly discovered species is named Idris elba ( no relation to the actor ) , and like other Idris wasps , it has an extremely bizarre life cycle . Females lay eggs inside developing cockroach embryos , where they hatch into larvae and proceed to devour the roach from within . But now we know that this particular species does n't stop there : it goes on to feast on the roach 's internal organs , including its heart , killing the poor bug in the process .

She began her career working for a few years as an independent jewelry designer , but she soon realized that she would have more control over the design process if she learned to fabricate her own pieces . In order to do so , she enrolled in La Cambre’s jewelry program . " I wanted to be able to see my ideas come to life without having to rely on someone else , ” she says . " It was a challenge to go back to school at age 34 , but it’s been one of the best decisions I ever made . ”

# ::tok In recent months , anti - abortion groups have been pushing similar ordinances in cities around the country . The ordinances are part of a wave of hundreds of new state laws restricting abortion that have passed since Republicans took full control of state legislatures across the South and Midwest in 2010 . But the local measures may be even more effective than the state ones at shutting down clinics , since they apply to all women in the community , not just those living in the immediate state .

# ::tok Fifty years ago , the publication of " Fear of Flying” caused a literary sensation and helped to launch the sexual revolution . The author Erica Jong said she wrote the novel because she couldn’t find one that spoke honestly about female desire . Her heroine was Isadora Wing , a poet who had a lust for life and sex ( and her analyst ) . Ms. Jong’s frankness made her an overnight feminist celebrity . But today , many women say they can’t relate to her dream of freedom through s ex. For them , fear of harassment has replaced the fear of flying .

# ::tok Amid terrible events like those in Haiti , people often ask why God would let such a thing happen . I do n't know what you believe about that , and I certainly wo n't try to tell you what to think . But for me , it helps to remember that we are part of an ongoing creation story , and it is up to us to help write its ending . It also helps to focus on the good news coming out of Haiti , like this story about a 10 - year - old boy who was rescued after eight days under the rubble . The power of prayer has helped him survive , he said ; now it 's up to us to keep praying—and working .

# ::tok The new report by the Center for European Policy Analysis , titled " Beyond Crimea : The New Russian Empire , ” provides an excellent analysis of Russia’s imperial policy in Ukraine . In particular , it focuses on the war against Ukraine launched by Moscow after the latter’s unsuccessful attempt to install a puppet regime in Kyiv through the use of force . One of its chapters is dedicated to the prospects and risks of a frozen conflict scenario in Donbas , which is quite timely given that this topic has recently become a subject of heated debate among Ukrainian politicians , experts and society at large .

# ::tok There is one thing we know for sure about the universe . It 's weird . Very , very weird . The rules that govern the world around us are completely alien on a cosmic scale . In this talk I will show you how the universe works , and why it seems so bizarre to our puny human minds . From dark matter to black holes , quantum mechanics to general relativity , I will tell you what we know , what we think we know , and what we still have no idea about .

# ::tok New Zealand’s new government has said it will scrap a proposed ban on smoking in cars carrying children . The bill was introduced by the former Labour - led government , but was not passed before its term ended with September’s election . Prime Minister John Key said the new National Party - led coalition would repeal the legislation . Mr Key said he did not agree with smoking in cars , but said banning it was not the role of government . " I don’t believe the state should be telling people how to bring up their children , ” he told reporters .

# ::tok Israel’s Supreme Court rejected an attempt by the country’s legislature to limit its power , including on matters of religion and state . The court struck down a law passed last year that would have allowed the Knesset to override decisions by the court with a simple majority vote . " The Basic Law is intended to harm the status and standing of this court , ” Justice Hanan Melcer wrote in the ruling . " It is meant to ‘cut off the branch’ on which it sits . ” He said the court would not be able to fulfill its role as protector of civil rights if it were subjected to such political control . The decision was hailed by religious pluralism advocates , who had feared the legislation could be used to block their efforts to gain equal recognition under Israeli law .

# ::tok The first large - scale offshore wind farm in the U.S. started delivering power to Massachusetts on Monday , according to its developers . The five - turbine project off Block Island , R.I. , is generating electricity for Rhode Island and can send up to 154 megawatts of power to New England through a submarine cable . That 's enough to supply about 30,000 homes . Deepwater Wind , which developed the $ 290 million facility , says it will help reduce carbon emissions by more than 40,000 tons per year — equivalent to taking nearly 10,000 cars off the road .

# ::tok Seek so much to be a man of your word that you will always keep promises , even when it hurts . The most important thing about keeping a promise is not the actual keeping of the promise , but what happens inside you while you are deciding whether or not you should keep it . When you decide in favor of keeping a promise , you become stronger and more trustworthy . When you break a promise , you diminish yourself and weaken the respect others have for you . You make yourself smaller each time you break a promise . A good way to think about promises is this : If you say you 're going to do something , then you really ought to do it . After all , you said you were going to do it , did n't you ? It does n't matter whether or not anyone else knows about it ; you know about

# ::tok In recent years , a growing number of companies have adopted the subscription business model . In this model , consumers pay for products or services on an ongoing basis rather than making one - time purchases . This approach has proven to be popular with both consumers and entrepreneurs alike . On the consumer side , there is often convenience in being able to receive regular shipments of items like razors , makeup , clothing , or pet food . For entrepreneurs , it can help create predictable revenue streams and improve forecasting capabilities .

# ::tok For the lead - up to Halloween , Ira and company have been doing a series of scary stories . The most recent episode , " And the Call Was Coming from the Basement , " features a story about a man who goes on an investigation after his phone starts receiving calls from his own number . He finds that he 's not the only one experiencing this phenomenon , but there are no easy answers as to what is causing it or why . This is a fantastic story , and I highly recommend checking out the rest of the scary episodes in the archive .

# ::tok The fragile truce was threatened when Palestinians captured two Israeli soldiers during a raid on an army post in Gaza . Israel responded by detaining dozens of Palestinian prisoners and later killed several Hamas leaders . In retaliation for this assassination , a suicide bomber attacked a bus full of children in Jerusalem killing 20 people . Sharon then ordered his troops back into West Bank cities they had previously withdrawn from under the terms of the cease - fire agreement . ( Ha'aretz )

# ::tok This year’s memoirs from famous women are not only prolific but also profoundly different . In the past few months alone we’ve been treated to a book of short stories by Lena Dunham ; a collection of essays on feminism and social justice from Roxane Gay ; an advice tome from Amy Poehler ; and a meditation on love and heartbreak by Chrissy Teigen ( which is a little more than 100 pages long ) . All these books have been best sellers , and for good reason : Each has its own charms and its own insights into what it means to be a woman today .

# ::tok American families saw their wealth jump 2.7 % in the second quarter of this year , according to a new report from the Federal Reserve . The gain , which was driven by rising home prices and gains in the stock market , marked the seventh consecutive quarterly increase in household net worth . Households were also saving more , as the savings rate rose to 8.6 % from 8.3 % . The data comes on the heels of last week’s Commerce Department release showing that consumer spending rose just 0.1 % in July , while disposable income fell for the first time in more than three years .

# ::tok Three Tacoma police officers who were cleared of criminal wrongdoing after fatally shooting a black man armed with a knife will receive more than half a million dollars each as part of an agreement for them to resign . The News Tribune reports the city announced Monday that Officer Joseph Hairston will be paid $ 612,749 and Officers Brian McGovern and Michael Waters will each get $ 538,046 . They are expected to resign Tuesday . City Manager Elizabeth Pauli says the agreement was reached so all parties can move forward . In 2016 , the three officers shot and killed 35 - year - old William Langfitt when they say he lunged at them with a knife while his family was present during a domestic violence call

# ::tok The complex dance of humanity and nature , of humankind and its environment , is an inescapable part of life . The relationship between man and his surroundings has been explored by artists throughout history . In the 19th century , Romanticists such as Caspar David Friedrich and John Constable saw the natural world as a place to connect with God . By the 20th century , modernist painters such as Georgia O’Keeffe and Piet Mondrian reduced their subjects to basic forms , creating artworks that expressed spiritual qualities through abstraction .

# ::tok When the Spanish singer María José Llergo sings " I Am a Woman , ” her voice is an instrument of passionate self - possession and empowerment . She leans into the song , which is written in Andalusian Arabic dialect , with defiance and pride . The song was recorded by Ms. Llergo for the 2018 documentary film " Yo , la peor de todas” ( " Me , the Worst of All” ) , about the life of the 17th - century Mexican nun and poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz . It is one of many songs that she has collected , preserved or created as part of her mission to amplify the voices of women who have been historically ignored .

# ::tok Democrats in New Jersey retained their majority in both houses of the state Legislature after hard - fought races on Tuesday , according to The Associated Press . In the Assembly , Democrats won 52 seats and Republicans took 28 . There was one race too close to call Wednesday morning : District 16 , where incumbent Republican Jack Ciattarelli was holding a small lead over Democrat Andrew Zwicker . All 40 seats in the Senate were up for grabs this year because of redistricting . In that chamber , Democrats won 24 seats and Republicans won 16 . Voter turnout was low ; only about a quarter of registered voters cast ballots .

# ::tok On July 18 , 2006 , when Brian Sullivan and Lindsay McCabe first met at the bar of an Irish pub in New York City , it was far from love at first sight .

# ::tok When people ask me what my favorite horror movie is , I always tell them " The Shining . ” And I’m not alone : the 1980 film adaptation of Stephen King’s novel frequently makes lists of the best horror films ever made . The Stanley Kubrick - directed picture stars Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall as a couple who take their son on a winter caretaker job at an isolated hotel that goes horribly wrong . It was recently added to Netflix in the UK , so you can stream it there now . But for us Yanks , it’ll have to wait until Halloween night — which is when you should really watch this one anyway .

# ::tok Two Malaysian prisoners pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of conspiracy in the deadly 2002 bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali . The two men , Noordin Top and Azahari Husin , are accused of helping plan the attacks that killed more than 200 people at nightclubs popular with Western tourists . A spokesman for the prosecution said both men admitted their guilt during a closed hearing Wednesday morning . Noordin is also suspected of planning last October 's hotel blasts in Jakarta that killed 18 people . He was arrested last year after being shot by police as he tried to flee from his hideout . Azahari was caught last November while hiding in a rented house .

The elder Collins is accused of giving inside information about Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited ( INNMF ) —an Australian biotech firm on whose board he sat at the time—to his son Cameron and Stephen Zarsky , the father of Cameron 's fiancée , as well as to unnamed others , so they could sell their shares before a clinical trial failure was announced publicly .

# ::tok Microsoft is poised to beat the odds and pull off a deal that would make it a major player in the video game business , after federal antitrust regulators said they had no immediate plans to challenge its proposed $ 250 million investment in Santa Monica - based Activision . Microsoft 's planned acquisition of a 19 percent stake in the nation 's No. 2 video game publisher was announced last month but has not yet been consummated because it must first win approval from the Federal Trade Commission and European Union authorities . The deal also faces opposition from some shareholders who think it undervalues Activision stock .

# ::tok For my entire life , I 've lived in a world where the internet was a place for me to be myself . The internet was a place for all the weird kids who did n't have any friends and wanted to connect with other weird kids like them . The internet was the only place you could find people who understood what it felt like to be bullied or harassed at school every day . When I was 13 years old , the internet was a sanctuary . It was a safe haven from everything bad in the real world . It was a place where I could talk to people who had similar interests as me . It was a place where I could learn about things that I could n't learn about in school because my teachers were either too busy or not interested enough to teach us anything worth

# ::tok In the International Criminal Court , we have seen that some of the most heinous crimes known to mankind have been committed by armies and groups that did not wear uniforms . Therefore , in such circumstances , it is difficult to say who is a combatant or non - combatant . It becomes very easy for people who do not wear uniforms to be able to commit war crimes and get away with it because they are not identifiable as soldiers .

# ::tok In the months that followed , she began to write again . She wrote for herself , and for those who would never have their stories told otherwise : the women of the Holocaust , the wives and mothers who were sent to concentration camps with their children ; the victims of the siege of Leningrad , where more than one million civilians died of starvation during World War II . Their experiences became the basis for her first novel , The Women in the Castle ( 2017 ) . It was named an Amazon Best Book of April 2017 , received the Medici Book Club Prize , and is being translated into 15 languages .

# ::tok Twelve months ago , I wrote a column for Barron’s that offered my 10 predictions for the stock market in 2018 . The headline was " My Predictions : Get Ready for Dow 36,000 . ” I expected the Dow Jones Industrial Average to end this year at 35,950 , with a high of 40,700 and a low of 25,000 . As we approach the end of the year , the Dow has fallen more than 1,200 points from its peak in early October , but it is still up about 2 % .

# ::tok When it comes to the Sundance Film Festival , I have no idea what I 'm doing . The festival is a beast and even though this year marks my third trip to Park City , Utah , for its annual 10 - day celebration of independent film , I still feel like a stranger in a strange land . The first time around , I was just happy to be there . Last year , I knew where all the free parties were . This year ? Well , I 've got an iPhone and a lot of people to meet up with . But that does n't mean I 've figured out how to navigate through the mountains of snow , screenings , panels and events . So , once again , I will be relying on the kindness of strangers and the advice of friends . Lucky me

# ::tok For more than 30 years , a joint venture between General Motors ( GM ) and Toyota produced cars in Fremont , California . The New United Motor Manufacturing Inc . , or NUMMI for short , was at one time the most successful auto plant in North America , with high productivity and quality . In 1984 , GM and Toyota agreed to end their partnership , but due to contractual obligations they continued to produce cars together until March 2010 when the last Corolla rolled off the assembly line . This case tells the story of how GM and Toyota came to collaborate , how the partnership was organized , and why it ultimately failed .

# ::tok Until 2011 , conscription was mandatory in Switzerland , which maintains a military force of about 350,000 men and women . Now , citizens are allowed to choose between compulsory service and an alternative program called Zivildienst ( Civilian Service ) . The Swiss government has also begun accepting some asylum seekers into the army , but this is limited by the country 's restrictive policy on immigration : foreigners must be born in Switzerland and have resided there for at least ten years before they can apply for citizenship . This means that even if an immigrant serves in the army , he or she may not be eligible for permanent residency in the country .

# ::tok Five years ago , on November 8 , 2018 , a spark from a power line ignited what would become California 's deadliest and most destructive wildfire . The Camp Fire burned more than 500 miles in Butte County — killing 86 people , destroying nearly 19,000 buildings and displacing some 40,000 residents . More than 3,000 families lost their homes . Today , about half of those families have returned to Paradise . And as we hear from KQED’s Lesley McClurg , they are living with memories of that day and uncertainty about what the future holds for the town .

# ::tok Q : We live in a rural neighborhood . A woman across the street has been feeding stray cats for about two years now . She also leaves food out for them to eat at will , which attracts raccoons and other wildlife . As you might guess , this is not good for our property values . We have complained to her , but she does n't care what we think . We 've called animal control , but they say there is nothing they can do . I 'm afraid that if we complain too much , our neighbors are going to turn against us . What else can we do ? — C.S. , via email

# ::tok After years of a hands - off approach , the city has proposed new ordinances that would give police officers more power to arrest or fine people suspected of using or possessing drugs . The City Council is expected to vote on them this fall . In addition , the mayor and city commissioners have been talking about declaring an outright ban on camping in city parks — a further ratcheting up of the pressure on addicts .

# ::tok Early in the morning on Thursday , February 18th , a small group of art dealers and journalists gathered at the booth of Luxembourg & Dayan at the Frieze Los Angeles fair . The conversation was focused on what the art market might look like in 5 years’ time . " A lot can happen in five years , ” said Adam Sheffer , president of Cheim & Read gallery , which has two locations , one in New York and another in the Hamptons . " The art world is changing so fast that it’s almost impossible to predict . ” Yet many of the participants agreed that there will be more art fairs than ever before—and they’ll become even bigger .

On September 30 , 2011 , drones hit Awlaki while he was traveling through northern Yemen ; he died instantly . Two weeks later , Awlaki’s 16 - year old son , Abdulrahman , an American citizen , also was killed by drone fire while eating at an outdoor restaurant .

The first two reports , which dealt with the economic impacts of the 2014 and 2015 labor disputes , found that the work stoppages had a relatively small effect on overall employment and wage trends in the affected industries . The third report , an analysis of the 2016-2017 Broadway League strike , showed more substantial effects , but these effects were concentrated among a relatively small number of workers .

# ::tok As dinner tables and supermarket shelves are stocked with more foods from plants , it’s important to consider how our choices affect the water supply . A new study published in Environmental Research Letters shows that a typical vegetarian diet requires 320 gallons of groundwater per day , while a meat - rich diet needs just 170 gallons . The reason is simple : it takes a lot of water to grow crops , especially ones high in protein like nuts and legumes .

# ::tok I started making this blanket for my new granddaughter . I did n't know the sex of the baby so it was a yellow and green blanket with pink and blue hearts in the corners to keep it gender neutral . The baby came early , she is a girl and I had no time to make her a blanket before she was born . When I got home from the hospital visit I decided to change the blanket from yellow / green to all pink . As I ripped out the yellow / green rows I thought how much easier it would be to just buy one . But as I continued on , row by row , I realized that I wanted to give her something made with love and that would last for years . After all I have 2 blankets knitted by my great

# ::tok I am a big fan of the series . I have seen them all except 59 , which is not on Netflix yet . The one thing that you did not mention was how it is interesting to see how the subjects changed over time as they became more aware of the documentary project . It seems like by the third or fourth film , they were becoming more introspective about their lives . One of my favorite parts of 49 Up was when the subject who grew up in poverty mentioned how he wished he had talked more about his childhood home in an earlier installment .

He was 84 years old , though he would have argued that he was only 73 , because that’s how old he was during his greatest triumph : winning the 2016 presidential election .

The impasse jeopardizes an accord reached last week by bipartisan negotiators who sought to end the stalemate over border security and reopen the government . President Trump is insisting on billions of dollars for his proposed wall along the southern border with Mexico . Democrats are demanding new limits on Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , the agency responsible for detaining and deporting migrants found living illegally in this country . [ … ]

# ::tok " Beyond Utopia , ” a new show of drawings and sculptures by the Los Angeles artist Alice Könitz , is not about utopias . It is about exits . The title refers to an essay from 1967 by the art critic Lucy Lippard , " Escape Attempts” ( or " Ausstiegsversuche” in its original German ) . In it , Ms. Lippard coined the phrase " Beyond Utopia” to describe the impulse toward individual liberty that had taken hold of artists since World War II . This was the age of Happenings , Fluxus and conceptual art — or what she called " concept - art . ” Ms. Lippard wrote admiringly of these movements’ efforts to free art from the marketplace ,

# ::tok THURSDAY — Hi , I 'm a 7th grader at a middle school in New Jersey . My school is having a spelling bee on May 19 . There are 3 people going to the county spelling bee and there are only 5 students in my grade . So we have an excellent chance of going to counties ! We also have a great chance of going to states because last year one person went and he was in 6th grade . Do you know any good tips that will help me win ? Thanks !

# ::tok As children , Uché Blackwell and her brother spent summers with their grandmother in Harlem . One day , they discovered a box of photos and letters among her belongings . The documents revealed the existence of an older sister they had never known about , Anita Hemmings , Vassar College 's first African American graduate . Determined to find out what happened to this sister no one talked about , Blackwell uncovered a story that would upend her family history . In her book , " The Family Next Door : A Memoir , ” she traces her mother’s journey from Trinidad to America in search of opportunity , and how race , class , and color have shaped the women in her family for generations .

# ::tok In 1994 , the American Psychological Association published a report on residential treatment programs for troubled teens . The authors had visited numerous facilities and interviewed staff members , as well as children who were living in them . They concluded that most of these places are not only ineffective but abusive . " We found evidence of a therapeutic rationale that is based on faulty theory and research , ” they wrote . They also reported that " clients have been exposed to dangerous procedures . ” Yet , despite such findings , today there are more than a hundred of these institutions operating in the United States—and many more abroad . In recent years , the industry has spread to Mexico , Costa Rica , Samoa , and Jamaica , among other countries .

It turned out that Soto had silicosis , an irreversible lung disease caused by prolonged exposure to silica dust . Silica is a mineral found in sand , rock and soil ; it can be released into the air as fine particles when workers cut , saw or drill materials like concrete or stone .

The Panthers have fallen off since Cam Newton’s car accident and now sit at 3-4-1 . They are tied with the Saints for second place in the division , while the Bucs are atop it with a record of 5-4 . If all three teams finish 9-7 or worse , then the Vikings would take one of the two wild card spots . There are other scenarios where they could get in as well

# ::tok The Israeli military said Monday that it had detained more than 300 terrorists in the Gaza Strip , some of them Hamas members , and that it was prepared to release them if the Palestinian militant group freed Cpl . Gilad Shalit , the soldier abducted by gunmen on Sunday . The statement offered no proof that any of the detainees were involved in Corporal Shalit 's capture , but it signaled Israel 's determination to link his fate to its battle with Hamas , which has carried out dozens of suicide bombings and other attacks against Israelis .

# ::tok France on Wednesday rejected accusations of genocide against Israel made by a pro - Palestinian group , saying the use of such language was " unacceptable . " The move came after France 's Cour de Cassation -- its highest appeals court -- overturned an earlier ruling that had thrown out charges brought by the Palestinian Association for Justice ( APJ ) accusing Israeli officials of war crimes . " We consider this wording totally unacceptable and contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Human Rights , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said at a regular news briefing in Paris .

# ::tok In a city where public transit is often overlooked and many of the freeways are named after former California governors ( the Arroyo Seco Parkway was renamed the Pasadena Freeway in honor of former governor Earl Warren ) , it 's no wonder that people think of them as landmarks . The fact that Los Angeles has the most freeway lane - miles per capita of any city in the world makes it even more understandable why people use them to navigate around town .

# ::tok After George Hawkins , 64 , was released from prison last year , he said he felt like a new man . He had served his time for assault and robbery in Tennessee and was ready to start fresh . But when Mr. Hawkins tried to register to vote , state officials rejected him . In Tennessee , people convicted of felonies are permanently disenfranchised unless they receive individual pardons . This month , Mr. Hawkins became one of three named plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of that policy , arguing that it is racially discriminatory . The suit , filed by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and other groups , says Tennessee’s law has its roots in white supremacist politics after the Civil War and continues

# ::tok My earliest memories are of my father and me watching The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson . I was too young to stay up late enough to see the entire show , but my dad would let me come downstairs when he got home from work at 10:30 p . m. , and we 'd watch together until it was time for me to go back to bed . Those were precious moments for me ; it 's when I first learned about what makes people laugh and why .

# ::tok It’s January , a time when we resolve to improve our lives in countless ways . Some resolutions are healthy : lose weight , get more exercise , cut down on sugar , drink less alcohol , eat more vegetables . Others have to do with improving ourselves spiritually or emotionally : meditate daily , volunteer at a homeless shelter , learn to say " no , ” stop gossiping , be kinder to people who annoy you . Still others focus on getting ahead professionally : read business books , go back to school , start your own company . And some have to do with financial stability : save money , pay off debt , make more investments .

# ::tok It is early September , and a man 's mind turns to football . I am not talking about the NFL or college ball . I mean high school football . This is the time of year when the weather begins to cool down and there is a crispness in the air on Friday nights . It means that the local stadium will be packed with fans dressed in red and white ( or blue and gold ) cheering for their team . I can smell the hot dogs and hamburgers cooking , and hear the marching band practicing . Yes , it is football season again . The first game of the season is tomorrow night .

" Mr. Hanks is obviously very disturbed by this situation , as well as the potential ramifications of this technology being used and seen by other notable celebrities , ” said Matthew Grossman , chief operating officer at Buzz , Mr. Hanks’s Los Angeles - based agency .

# ::tok At an emotional press conference in the Capitol on Thursday afternoon , Kevin McCarthy announced he was dropping out of the race for speaker of the House . He was set to replace John Boehner when Boehner resigned at the end of October , but said that he did n't feel he could get the 218 votes needed from his colleagues to win the election . " I think I shocked some of you , huh ? ” McCarthy joked as he took questions from reporters . It wasn’t a joke . The move is a stunning political development , one that leaves Republicans without a clear path forward and Democrats giddy with schadenfreude .

# ::tok There were times , watching the first two episodes of Season 3 of " True Detective , ” that I thought I was watching a new film by Michael Mann . This is not to say that the show is as good as Mr. Mann’s best work ( though it comes close ) , but rather that there are certain visual and dramatic strategies — especially in the use of digital photography for interior scenes and the way the story is structured around three main characters — that have been lifted from his playbook .

# ::tok Few challenges are as daunting to a newcomer as figuring out how to get around in an unfamiliar city . The Metro system is the most efficient way of getting from one place to another , but sometimes it 's not that easy to figure out which line to take and where you need to get off . There are several apps for smartphones that can help with this , but my preferred method is much more old - fashioned : I use the street map in the back of the Madrid section of Lonely Planet guidebooks .

# ::tok As 2023 comes to a close , we see that the United States has become an even more divided country . The middle class is almost gone , and the gap between rich and poor continues to grow wider and wider . There are more people in prison than ever before , and more Americans on government assistance programs than ever before . While a few wealthy enclaves flourish , most of the rest of the country is deeply suffering . The divide between Republicans and Democrats grows deeper every single year , and it has gotten to the point where many Republicans and many Democrats absolutely hate one another . Mexico has fallen apart economically and socially , and millions upon millions of illegal aliens continue to pour across the border with no end in sight . Meanwhile , other nations such as China have risen to take America

# ::tok For years , a group of about 1,200 people who claim to be descendants of the Montaukett Indians have been trying to get New York State recognition as an Indian tribe . On Thursday , Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed a bill that would have granted them that status — the fifth time in recent years that their quest has been denied by a governor .

# ::tok The U.S. military 's Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps ( J.R.O.T.C. ) program is the nation 's largest and most popular high school elective , with more than 314,000 students enrolled in 2006-7 . According to the American Civil Liberties Union , that number could soon increase exponentially as a result of a little known provision buried deep within the No Child Left Behind Act ( NCLB ) . The ACLU alleges that Section 9528 , which was added to the law during House - Senate conference negotiations in late 2001 , requires all public schools receiving federal funding to provide equal access to J.R.O.T.C. cadets .

# ::tok In the ancient world , the occult was often seen as a science . Some of the greatest minds in human history were drawn to its study and practice . In 1904 , the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn ( a society that claimed several prominent figures as members , including William Butler Yeats and Winston Churchill ) created the Horos mysticorum , an educational program that included classes in astrology , alchemy , tarot reading , geomancy , clairvoyance , divination and other esoteric disciplines . The program culminated with a master’s degree in the occult arts .

# ::tok Yes , we know , the tickets are expensive . But here is an insider secret : You can get into Weill Recital Hall without buying a ticket . The downstairs café ( the Café ) is open to the public during concerts and intermissions , and you can come in just to listen to the music . Of course , it’s much better if you do buy a ticket—you get a seat on the main floor of the hall , or you can sit up in the balcony where there’s more space and a better view .

# ::tok Inflation in the euro area fell faster than expected to a three - year low of 0.3 % in September , as energy prices plunged and economic weakness kept a lid on consumer demand .

According to AAA , more than 103 million Americans are expected to travel during this year’s holiday season – the most since 2005 . In fact , the National Safety Council estimates that over 430 people could be killed on our roads in December alone as a result of car crashes caused by drunk driving , speeding , texting or other dangerous behaviors . That’s why we’re working hard to help make it easier for you to get around town with Google Maps , whether you’re visiting family and friends across the country , or just heading out for last minute shopping closer to home .

# ::tok In the 17th century , Portuguese Jesuit missionaries introduced the catechism to the Catholic communities of Goa . The practice was carried by the Goan diaspora to East Africa , where it remains popular today . This paper examines the performance of catechisms in a Goan community in Nairobi as a way of understanding how migrants negotiate their belonging within and outside of Kenya through religious practices . Through an ethnographic study of the catechism , I will explore how Goans make sense of their place in Kenyan society through a complex negotiation of religion , ethnicity and nationality . In particular , I will show how the catechism enables Goans to re - imagine themselves as a religiously unified group with deep roots in

So what are the books coming out this fall that you should have on your radar ? We asked our fellow readers and here’s what they said .

# ::tok Economists spent much of the past year fretting about a slowdown in consumer spending , only to watch Americans spend more than ever this holiday season . Now they’re wondering if it’s time to hit reset on their projections for 2019 . " People are looking at the headlines and saying : ‘This is great news . ’ But we don’t think the data is going to be consistent with the narrative , ” said Gregory Daco , chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics . " The fundamentals still suggest that consumption will weaken next year . ” The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.8 % from October to November , the best monthly gain since February 2017 . Sales were up 5.3 %

# ::tok An article on Page A10 about the sentencing of former Representative Randy Cunningham misstated the circumstances under which he was allowed to remain free pending his appeal . Judge Larry Alan Burns said he would not revoke Mr. Cunningham 's bail if prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence no longer than 10 years . The judge did not say he would reduce the term by two years because of an agreement between defense and prosecution lawyers that Mr. Cunningham 's prison term should be limited to eight years .

She’s rarely played someone this vulnerable or this sad on screen . Her latest film , " Long Shot , ” is also a love story — but this time around , she’s not playing the romantic interest .

# ::tok At least 40 percent of farm workers are over the age of 35 . That’s about double what it was in 2000 , according to the latest U.S. Department of Labor statistics . And the number of workers older than 65 has tripled since then . These numbers reflect both the aging baby boomer population and increased immigration restrictions that have slowed the flow of young people from Mexico into the United States . As a result , there is a growing demand for experienced workers , even as fewer Americans want to do this type of work . This combination is keeping many older farm workers employed .

A new study suggests it 's been around for at least a century or two . ...

# ::tok A few years ago , my husband and I were shopping for a Christmas tree at the local Home Depot . After we paid for it , the cashier asked if we wanted to donate money to support the planting of more trees . We gave her our money , but then realized that there was no need to plant new trees—all she needed to do was take our tree back outside . Our tree could have been replanted and grown again !

# ::tok The rapid rise of the pop star Lizzo is a story that is both heartwarming — because she 's so much fun to root for — and maddening — because it should have happened sooner . With the release of her latest album , Cuz I Love You , she 's finally getting the recognition she deserves ; last weekend , in a true sign of stardom , she performed at Coachella in front of a giant inflatable butt . This week , we 'll hear from her on how her life has changed now that she 's having a hit single with " Juice . " We 'll also talk about Billie Eilish 's meteoric success , and listen to new music from Khalid and the country singer - songwriter Maren Morris . Also

# ::tok A volcano in southern Iceland erupted on Wednesday for the first time since 1823 , forcing hundreds to evacuate and sending huge plumes of smoke and ash into the air . The cloud of ash was heading toward Scotland , forecasters said , raising concerns about possible disruptions to aviation there . In a statement , Iceland 's Meteorological Office said it had raised its aviation warning level to red , meaning that an eruption is imminent or under way , with a risk of spewing ash . It said the eruption was believed to have started around 9:30 p . m. local time at the Eyjafjallajokull glacier , which covers the caldera of a volcano that last erupted

# ::tok When you’re choosing the right curtains for your home , it’s important to consider a few things . The first is whether or not they will fit with the existing decor of your room , and if they will match the color scheme . You also need to think about how much sunlight they let in , as well as their energy efficiency . It’s also important to consider what type of fabric you want them made out of , as this will determine the longevity of your curtains . However , no matter which ones you choose , you can hang them yourself if you follow these simple instructions .

# ::tok Britain’s Supreme Court has ruled that the Home Office cannot deport asylum seekers to Rwanda if they face a real risk of persecution there because of their race or ethnic origin . The court rejected an appeal by the British government against an earlier decision by the Court of Appeal that it was unlawful to remove individuals from Britain to Rwanda on the basis of assurances given by the Kigali regime . The ruling will have implications for other countries to which the U.K. seeks to return refugees whose applications are rejected .

# ::tok In the most recent issue of Wired magazine ( March 2015 ) , there is an article by Mat Honan entitled , " Love Letter : When Google Search Reveals Too Much " . It 's a great read about how our lives are revealed through search results . I encourage you to check it out . The article focuses on how a Google search for his name reveals a lot of personal information about him . It 's not necessarily bad stuff - just stuff that he would prefer be private and confidential .
