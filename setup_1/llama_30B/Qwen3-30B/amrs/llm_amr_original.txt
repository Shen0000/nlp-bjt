# ::tok The prime minister of Papua New Guinea , Michael Somare , has declared a state of emergency in the capital , Port Moresby , after rioting over the past week left at least 18 people dead and hundreds injured . The unrest began last Thursday when residents angry about government plans to relocate them from settlements on the edge of the city clashed with police . Hundreds of youths burned cars and buildings , including several government offices . Mr. Somare said he would not allow a small minority to disrupt life in the city . He blamed the violence on the use of marijuana by some young people . A police spokesman said a number of suspects had been arrested and that the situation was under control .

The stock market had been cut in half . The government was bailing out major financial institutions and debating whether to do so for automakers . And in many parts of the country , housing prices were still falling .

Their aim : to get pollinated by insects or other animals so that they can reproduce—a process that also helps the plants produce fruits and seeds that feed many different species .

# ::tok The Supreme Court 's decision in the census case is one of the most important decisions it will make this term , and not just because of the importance of an accurate count . As Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted during oral argument last month , the Constitution makes clear that Congress is in charge of redistricting . So if the administration succeeds in rigging the census count — by adding a citizenship question to discourage noncitizens from participating — it could affect how many congressional seats each state gets for the next decade .

# ::tok When Michael Stipe and R.E.M. announced their breakup in 2011 , it was the end of an era . The Athens , Georgia , band had become one of the most influential in rock history , with songs like " Losing My Religion , ” " Everybody Hurts” and " Man on the Moon . ” Stipe’s haunting voice and cryptic lyrics were at the heart of every R.E.M. song , but when the band split up , he left music behind entirely . In a new interview with Pitchfork , Stipe says that he’s now thinking about what his next act will be — though it might not be as a singer - songwriter .

# ::tok I first heard Sleater - Kinney in 2005 , when I was 14 . A friend of mine played me the song " Was It a Lie ? ” from their album The Woods and I was immediately hooked . I listened to that song over and over , but when I tried listening to other songs by them , nothing compared . So I didn’t think much more about it until five years later , when my friend gave me her copy of Dig Me Out for my birthday . I put the CD on in my car stereo and pressed play .

# ::tok There are many things in our lives that we take for granted . For instance , I grew up thinking that a glass of water was something that was always available to me whenever I needed it . It never occurred to me that there were places where people had to walk miles and miles just to get some water for themselves or their families . And yet , that is exactly what happens every single day . In fact , according to UNICEF , every 20 seconds a child dies from a water - related disease . That is why I have decided to support charity : water .

# ::tok Ukraine scored a rare victory against Russia over the weekend . On Sunday , Ukrainian forces hit and damaged one of Moscow’s most advanced warships , which was shelling the port city of Mariupol from the Azov Sea . In response , Russia withdrew its fleet to safer waters further away from Ukraine’s shoreline . The development is particularly significant because it indicates that Ukraine may have developed some effective defenses against the regular barrage of artillery fire coming from across the border .

# ::tok " Inspector Sun , ” a 2019 film by Liang Heng , is a remake of the 1958 classic " The Crimson - Cloaked Detective” ( Hong yin xiong ) , which was directed by and starred Taiwanese martial arts superstar Huo Feng . The film has been hailed as an innovative work for its use of a single shot that lasts the entire duration of the movie . Although the idea of using one continuous camera movement to tell a story is not new , it is still quite rare in Chinese cinema , and Liang deserves credit for making this technique central to his film .

# ::tok Growing up in a military family , I moved around a lot when I was young , but no matter where I went , I always had one constant : McDonald 's chicken nuggets . When I was upset , I turned to them for comfort ; they were my go - to food when I needed some solace from the world . But as I got older , I started to realize that maybe it wasn’t healthy to turn to something so processed and unhealthy as my main source of comfort , and I decided to stop eating them altogether . For years , I stuck with this decision , only indulging once in a while . But last week , after my grandfather passed away , I found myself turning back to those delicious fried treats .

The hotel is one of those wonderful places that has an interesting history which makes you wonder about the characters who lived there . Built in 1931 by the British tea planter Frank Lumbard Smith , who was also a member of the Darjeeling Planters Club , it was used as a summer retreat for himself , his wife and their five children . It is said that he built the property so he could have a view over Darjeeling to the plains below . He would sit in the large bay window of the first floor library and watch the sun rise over the plains and set behind the mountains . In 1967 the property was sold to Mr N.K

# ::tok My wife became increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of sex outside our relationship . We had been together for 10 years , married for seven , and she agreed to an open marriage . But a few months ago , she reneged on that agreement and said it made her uncomfortable . We have a child together . She says she wants to be monogamous . Is this fair ? I feel as though I’m being lied to or cheated . Is there something I can do about it ? —Open Marriage Not So Open

# ::tok Maine’s top election official said she would appeal a federal judge’s ruling that ordered her to put the name of Donald J. Trump back on the ballot for the June 14 primary , a day after he was disqualified over what state officials described as incomplete paperwork . The secretary of state , Matthew Dunlap , filed an emergency motion on Friday to stay the order issued by Judge James D. Aiken of Federal District Court in Bangor . The judge’s ruling came one day after Mr. Trump failed to meet the deadline to submit at least 2,000 signatures from registered Maine voters to qualify for the state’s Republican presidential primary .

# ::tok The good news is that the movie theater business appears to be booming . The bad news is that there are just too many darn movies these days ! We are now in the thick of awards season and have reached a point where the race is so competitive that the best picture Oscar category has been expanded from five nominees to ten . This year’s crop is particularly strong and includes films like " Up in the Air , ” " Avatar , ” " Inglourious Basterds” and " Precious . ” But what about the other great films of 2009 ? Should they all get nominated or should some be left out ? And how will this affect next year’s race ?

# ::tok When Scotty Scott of Birmingham , Alabama 's Golden Rule Barbecue was a boy growing up in the ' 60s and ' 70s , he loved visiting his grandmother 's house . " She had a great big yard where we could play , " he recalls , " and she made some of the best fried chicken I 've ever tasted . " The chicken was fried in lard until it was golden brown and crispy on the outside but still juicy on the inside . Then it was served with a spiced - up version of white gravy made from the pan drippings and flour . " It was the best ! " says Scott .

# ::tok For many years , I was a professional fashion stylist . I have worked for magazines like i - D and Elle UK , as well as brands such as Nike , Levi’s , Adidas , and Diesel . In 2015 , I decided to change my life by moving to Berlin . I quit my job and went freelance . This meant that I had the time to start experimenting with upcycling clothes . I had been doing this in my spare time for a while already , but now I could take it seriously . I started sharing pictures of my projects on Instagram and people really liked them ! That’s how I came up with the idea to launch my own label .

# ::tok An article on Wednesday about the life of a man who was wrongly convicted in the killing of a 14 - year - old boy in Queens misstated the date of the murder and an incorrect year appeared in some editions . The victim , Kevin Pravia , was killed on Oct. 26 , 1985 , not 1983 . Because of an editing error , the article also referred incorrectly to the day the jury’s verdict was read . It was Dec. 27 , 2023 — not Dec. 27 , 2013 . And a correction in this space on Friday misspelled Mr. Pravia’s surname as Pravia .

# ::tok When Mayor Mike Bloomberg was looking for ways to close the New York City budget deficit in 2003 , he decided to take a page out of Henry George 's book . Mr. Bloomberg 's administration proposed raising property taxes on land that appreciated faster than neighboring properties over a five - year period . The proposal did n't get far : It faced opposition from homeowners and from real estate developers who worried it would discourage new construction . But it did manage to spark an intense debate about what should be done with the proceeds from any such tax increase .

# ::tok Because of severe cold weather , schools in Kentucky and Tennessee were closed . I 'm not sure why the author thinks this is a rare event . The article states that it was 10 degrees below zero in Atlanta on Wednesday morning . I can recall days in Minnesota when the temperature was well below zero , but the schools were never closed . In fact , when I was in school , we went outside for recess at - 30 degrees Fahrenheit ( which is - 34.4 Celsius ) . I do n't think we did much playing , though . We just ran around a bit to get some exercise , then went back inside where it was warm .

# ::tok The question of whether or not the United States should provide subsidies for green technology has been a hot - button issue as of late , especially since President Obama 's election in 2008 . While some are opposed to the idea of government - funded grants for green companies ( as they feel it amounts to picking winners and losers ) , others argue that government investment is necessary if we hope to compete with countries like China who already have their own green tech initiatives in place .

# ::tok Humans are a part of nature , but we do n't always behave like it . We have an innate tendency to seek dominion over the natural world and try to control it for our own benefit . This is a serious problem in today 's world , as our numbers grow exponentially and our technological abilities increase at a staggering rate . In addition to the massive amounts of energy we expend every day , we also produce huge quantities of waste . Our activities often have unintended consequences , and we can be very slow to react to these changes , because they tend to happen on a scale that we cannot easily perceive .

# ::tok The Italian Alps are home to some of the most beautiful lakes , valleys and villages in all of Europe . This trip offers you a chance to enjoy them all on a 10 - day journey through Italy’s northern mountain region . Beginning in Venice , we visit historic cities like Verona , Bolzano and Trento , and make our way into the heart of the Dolomites . We will spend time exploring Lake Garda , the largest lake in Italy , and the smaller but equally stunning Lake Braies , as well as the towns and villages nestled in their foothills . The spectacular scenery of the Dolomite mountains is reason enough to go there , but we also want to get a taste of the culture of this region . From the architecture of its churches

# ::tok OK , I’ll admit it . I am a big fan of " Gilmore Girls . ” I loved the series when it was on the air from 2000 to 2007 . It is still one of my favorite shows to watch in reruns . I love how smart the dialogue is and how witty the characters are . I even enjoy the silliness of some of the plots and the over - the - topness of some of the scenes ( like Rory and Paris running through Yale University with their books and laptops because they forgot to study for an exam ) . The show is just plain fun .

# ::tok As diplomats try to negotiate a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians , a different kind of battle is playing out on college campuses across America . It 's a fight over how Israel should be perceived , with some students pushing back against what they see as an effort by pro - Palestinian groups to delegitimize the Jewish state . The issue is at the center of several recent controversies that have divided college communities along political lines . At many schools , it has become commonplace for student governments to pass resolutions condemning Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . At San Francisco State University , anti - Semitic graffiti was scrawled on a wall near a campus hangout popular among Jewish students . The university is investigating whether the incident was a hate crime

# ::tok Members of the United Auto Workers ratified new four - year labor contracts with General Motors , Ford Motor and Chrysler Group on Friday . The deals were approved by more than three - quarters of voting members in each union . Union officials had said they expected the agreements to be overwhelmingly endorsed because they included a mix of wage increases , lump - sum payments and promises of future investment by the automakers .

You can pick whichever device or operating system you want and then personalize it with apps and services that fit your needs . But in recent years , tech companies like Apple , Google and Facebook have been slowly chipping away at that idea of digital freedom . They are using their market power to limit consumer choice — and we’re all paying the price . [ NYT ]

# ::tok The origin of this particular episode is fascinating . Al Jean and Mike Reiss were trying to come up with a Halloween - themed episode for season 2 but couldn’t find any ideas that worked ( which might explain why they ended up doing " Treehouse of Horror” in the first place ) . So instead , they decided to write an episode set on Thanksgiving…which was a few months away at the time . The writers even joked about the premise being " too specific” . Yet here we are , almost thirty years later , still watching it .

# ::tok When people ask me what my favorite movie is , I usually respond with something like " I’m not sure I can answer that” or " It depends on the day . ” But when pressed ( and even if not ) , I will often go to Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho . It’s the perfect film . The editing , score , and cinematography are all untouchable . Not only is it a masterpiece of suspense , but it’s also the most important horror film ever made . If you haven’t seen it , do yourself a favor and watch it today .

# ::tok Public libraries have always been a great resource for communities . In fact , they’re so useful that the United Nations considers them to be a human right . But there are still many people who aren’t aware of what their local library has to offer and others who can’t get there easily . That’s why Google is rolling out a new tool to help make these resources more accessible than ever before .

# ::tok The United Nations is seeking repayment from its former top official in the Congo of $ 63.6 million that he allegedly embezzled , according to a report released Wednesday by an independent investigator for the global organization . The former official , Youssouf Omar , who was known as Mr. Abdoulaye , has been under investigation since 2007 and was arrested on Tuesday in Paris after he failed to show up at his trial there on corruption charges . He fled to France after being fired from his job with the United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2008 .

# ::tok Far out in the desert of New Mexico , a small unmanned aerial vehicle climbs into the sky . It is one of several similar aircraft flying today at the White Sands Missile Range as part of an experiment to test whether artificial intelligence can be used to control military drones . The program is called ALICIA -- short for Airborne Launch and Initialization Control Interface Adapter -- and it was developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) . DARPA officials say that ALICIA represents a significant advance over previous attempts to use AI on drones . In earlier programs , computers were used simply to make decisions about what targets to attack . But in ALICIA , the computer controls all aspects of flight , from launching to landing . In this

# ::tok Twelve months ago , the financial world was in a panic about the prospect of a recession . The stock market had just finished one of its worst years since World War II , and many economists were predicting that things would only get worse . Today , with the economy showing signs of strengthening , some experts are saying the nation has already pulled out of the downturn . Others say it is too early to tell . And then there are those who believe that the United States is still in a recession , albeit a mild one , and that it could last for at least another six months .

# ::tok Until 2011 , conscription in Israel was compulsory for most Israeli citizens over the age of 18 ( women were exempt unless they volunteered ) , with some religious exceptions and those engaged in Yeshiva study . Conscientious objectors could opt out of military service if they agreed to an alternative civilian service . This option is open to all Israeli citizens regardless of religion or gender , including Arabs . As of 2015 , military conscription is not mandatory for women but it remains mandatory for men .

I know that sounds disgusting , but it’s true ! I’ve tried everything to get rid of this cat—pepper spray , water guns , even putting up " Beware of Dog” signs . Nothing works . What do you suggest ?

# ::tok Nikki Haley , the South Carolina governor who is running for president , has made a habit of talking about her state’s role in the American Civil War . On Thursday night , at an event in Charleston , she spoke to an audience of business leaders and political operatives about her home state’s " darkest days”—the moment when Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter , at the mouth of the harbor . It was April 12 , 1861 : the start of the war that would eventually end slavery .

# ::tok The word sentience means " the ability to feel or perceive . ” I’m pretty sure that a lot of us have heard of this word and we know what it means , but I’m also pretty sure that many of us don’t really care about the meaning . This is because most people are too busy with their own lives , which makes them unable to see the pain and suffering of others around them . They may even be aware of the pain and suffering of other living beings , but they just don’t care enough to do anything about it . This is why I like to use the term " sentient” as opposed to using the word " human . ” The reason for this is that the term sentient includes all conscious beings , not just humans .

# ::tok What do we mean by the term " conservative” ? The word itself has become so politically charged that it is almost useless to use , but it’s worth thinking about what we actually mean when we say someone is a conservative . I think we should understand being a conservative as being a person who believes in and seeks to preserve the traditional ways of living of his society . This may be thought of as a kind of instinctive attachment to one’s culture . Conservatives are not necessarily against change , but they tend to distrust radical changes and seek to preserve those things that make up the essence of their culture .

# ::tok A team of paleontologists from the University of Alberta have published an article in the journal Cretaceous Research that suggests a new origin story for Tyrannosaurus r ex. The researchers studied the remains of a 66 - million year old dinosaur they named Thanatotheristes degrootorum , which translates to " Reaper of Wickedness . ” This fossil is the first known tyrannosaur from the late Cretaceous period , and it’s helping scientists better understand how T. rex evolved . Host Sarah McConnell speaks with Scott Persons about the discovery . He’s one of the paleontologists who discovered the fossils and he is now with the University of Alberta .

# ::tok As children , Uché Blackstock and her mother faced a health care system that failed to treat them as individuals . When Uché became an oncologist , she found the same problems persisted . In this memoir , she unravels how doctors have historically viewed black women 's bodies in medicine : as hypersexualized , diseased , and undeserving of care . And she offers a bold vision for how to change the culture of medicine so that it is more effective at providing the highest quality health care to all people .

# ::tok It was a simple enough plan : The 12 - year - old boy had been asked to bring the car around to the front door . He did not know what the package taped under his seat was or that it was connected by wire to a detonator that he held lightly in his hand . All the boy knew was that his older brother had asked him for a favor and that this was a way to make money . But as the car neared its destination at the entrance of the Marriott Hotel here , the bomb went off , killing the driver , another teenager , along with the little boy .

# ::tok Ava DuVernay’s " Origin” is a documentary about racism . But it’s not the kind you might expect . Instead of looking at our history of bigotry and hatred , this film examines where that all came from . And it does so with intelligence and thoughtfulness . In a way , I suppose one could argue that " Origin” is an anti - racist propaganda piece . But it doesn’t feel like that . It feels more like a well - argued essay about why we think the things we do about race .

# ::tok The trucks carrying the goods are inspected by the UN . They are then supposed to be transferred to a warehouse controlled by the Palestinian Authority . But this process has been slowed down because Israel is not allowing enough trucks into the Strip each day for the aid agencies to keep up with demand . The number of trucks allowed in was reduced from 123 on December 17th to 60 on December 21st . By January 14th only 15 trucks were allowed in per day . This has led to shortages of many basic items such as sugar and flour .

As a result , many Kievans are enjoying uninterrupted slumber for the first time since the conflict began .

# ::tok Few filmmakers can claim to have been as influential and universally adored as Hayao Miyazaki . The Japanese animation legend has created a number of unforgettable characters in his films , from Ponyo to Kiki . But it is his most recent creation that may well be his most memorable : Jiro Horikoshi , the main character of his final feature film , The Wind Rises . Based on a true story , the movie focuses on Jiro , who dreamt of building beautiful planes for the Japanese government . He was successful in doing so , but was heartbroken when he realized that his creations would be used for war instead of peaceful purposes .

The US has been pushing the Ukrainians to attack for months , and now they have . It 's not clear whether this will lead to full - scale war again or not . There are conflicting reports about the intensity of the fighting , and it may be that what we 're seeing is just a limited offensive to take some key towns on the other side of the river . But there 's no guarantee that things wo n't escalate from here . ( WP , 09.28.16 )

# ::tok My partner and I are looking for a new home in the New York area , and we 're hoping to move this summer . We have an idea about what kind of place we want , but it will take some time to find the right one . We 've started the process by going to open houses every weekend , checking out listings online , and generally getting a sense of how much house we can afford . This has been an interesting learning experience because it has made me think more deeply than ever before about the role that authenticity plays in our lives .

# ::tok The evolution of Mozart’s opera The Magic Flute from its premiere in 1791 to the present day is a study in cultural appropriation , and it would be impossible to discuss the current production at the Metropolitan Opera without addressing that . The original libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder was filled with references to Freemasonry and other secret societies that were popular among the Viennese elite during the Enlightenment period . Its plot centers on Tamino , an initiate in search of knowledge about himself and the world around him .

# ::tok The Israeli military has plans to take over the entire Gaza Strip , including its largest city , if war erupts again with Palestinian militants . The documents were obtained by a former U.S. intelligence official who has provided them exclusively to Newsweek . They reveal that the Israeli military would target Hamas leadership in the event of any future military campaigns . The plan also calls for the Israeli army to move into the heart of Gaza City , which is the densely populated center of the tiny strip of land on the eastern Mediterranean coast .

# ::tok Let’s consider a few recent examples of this phenomenon , which I’ll call the antidemocratic quest to save democracy from Trump . Last week , an activist federal judge in Seattle issued a nationwide restraining order barring the enforcement of key provisions of the president’s executive order on immigration . The ruling was based not on any constitutional or statutory challenge , but rather on the claim that it violated " the Constitution and laws of the United States” — a constitutional phrase that , as far as I can tell , is completely meaningless , since the Constitution contains no general prohibition against the government acting unfairly or unreasonably ( and the courts have never recognized such a provision ) .

# ::tok Mati , the employee who helps out the family during Passover and other holidays is my favorite character . He has a very interesting life story and is a really good guy . I was disappointed that we didn’t get to see more of him in this season . The show is about religious observance but it’s also about a family dealing with loss and tragedy . They struggle to cope and find ways to move on . This is the first time that I watched the show and I plan to watch all the seasons in order . It’s worth your time .

# ::tok Through the long , hot summer of 2014 , Texas ambulances rushed toward a crisis . The wave of immigrants crossing the Rio Grande Valley illegally was so large that it overwhelmed local authorities and led to widespread human suffering . And one year later , little has changed . In fact , as the Obama administration announced Monday that it would increase enforcement along the border with Mexico , the migrant surge is expected to continue—and the problems are only likely to get worse .

# ::tok At an emotional meeting with his Republican colleagues in early December , House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried to explain why he was dropping out of the race to succeed John A. Boehner as speaker . Mr. McCarthy had been expected to win easily and seemed to have everything going for him : a close relationship with Mr. Boehner , a tight bond with Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin , and a well - oiled campaign operation that helped him raise $10 million for himself and his party . But then Mr. McCarthy did something few thought possible when he announced his candidacy months earlier — he lost .

# ::tok There were times , when watching the first two episodes of Season 3 of " True Detective , ” that I couldn’t help but think about how different this show is now . The series — which returns on Jan. 13 after a three - year absence and stars Mahershala Ali as Wayne Hays , an Arkansas detective investigating the disappearance of two children in the Ozarks in 1980 — has changed its tone , style and pacing . But it hasn’t lost its soul .

# ::tok Tasneem Ismael Ahel’s " An Audio Diary of Despair” is a series of 15 audio diaries , each composed of recorded conversations between the artist and people she meets on the streets of her hometown , Tripoli . The project , which began in September 2017 , was motivated by the increasingly frequent power outages that have affected life in the city since the 2011 Libyan civil war , when the country’s electrical grid was severely damaged . Since then , power cuts have become a daily occurrence , with no end in sight . In an effort to document this new reality for herself and others , Ahel records her interactions with strangers , asking them about their lives and how they are dealing with the lack of electricity .

# ::tok Shortly after Donald Trump’s election as president , a small group of lawyers and activists began meeting in Washington . They had no money or staff or office space , but they were united by the belief that the new administration would be a threat to civil rights across the country . They decided their first step was to create a hotline for people who had experienced or witnessed hate crimes and incidents of discrimination : an effort to turn the anger and fear felt by many Americans into action . They called it the SAFE ( South Asian Bar Association of Washington , DC ) Hotline .

# ::tok When Mary Lou Retton was a little girl in Fairmont , West Virginia , her parents couldn’t afford to pay for a gymnastics class . So she watched the other kids and practiced the moves they were learning on her own . She got good enough that when she finally enrolled at age 8 , she could skip ahead two levels . By 14 , she was good enough to win the American Cup all - around title , and at 16 , she won the Olympic gold medal .

# ::tok The mechanics of cheating at chess are simple . A person with a grandmaster - level brain sits down at the board , and then , when it is time to move , he or she sends the opponent a text message : " Rook to King 7 . ” The opponent dutifully makes that move , and the game continues . If the grandmaster has a friend on hand who can keep an eye on the other player’s phone , so much the better . The grandmaster does not even need to be in the same room . The person sitting across the board could simply be a pawn .

The lyrics tell of a man who is so angry that he could " buss head” — Trini slang meaning to go crazy .

# ::tok In the ancient world , divination was used to help determine the best course of action for people and nations alike . Kings , priests , and prophets all sought the wisdom of oracles , seers , and mediums before making weighty decisions . In fact , this practice was so widespread that it became one of the primary ways by which God revealed himself to humanity . The Old Testament records many examples of how God spoke through dreams , visions , and even animals . However , the New Testament reveals that we no longer need such signs because God has spoken to us clearly through his Son ( Hebrews 1:1 –2 ) .

# ::tok Michael Cunningham’s new novel , " The Snow Queen , ” is a love story of sorts — not a romance but a deep - seated , long - lasting friendship between two women . One of them is Liz , the wife of the other , Tyler . We first meet the couple in 1985 , on a winter afternoon in New York City , when Liz goes to visit Tyler at her office . They haven’t seen each other since college , and their reunion is awkward . But there’s also something warm about it : The two are happy to see each other again after all these years . And then the next time we see them , they’re together again , this time in a hospital room , watching over a third woman who has been diagnosed with AIDS .

The analysis comes just days after an unprecedented raid by the elite Iranian Quds Force on an oil field in Saudi Arabia and amid reports that the Houthis are receiving increasing amounts of military equipment from Tehran .

# ::tok Why is Donald Trump so popular ? The answer , as with most things in life , is complicated . But one of the biggest reasons is that he’s tapped into a real and justified sense of economic anxiety among Americans who have been left behind by globalization , technology , and the modern economy . A new Pew survey helps explain why these voters feel this way , and also highlights the deep divide between their views and those of more affluent Americans .

# ::tok In 2014 Jony Ive made some statements about wearable tech , and how he was not a fan of the current smartwatches on the market . The Apple Watch is a much more refined product . It’s still in its infancy but it has been received better than most expected . With this device , Apple has set the standard for what a smartwatch should be . There are now many competitors who have attempted to imitate the success of the Apple Watch . The Apple Watch also opened the door for other products like AirPods , which have been very successful .

# ::tok During a news conference following the meeting , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said that he expects the economy will grow between 2 and 3 percent in 2016 . However , there is no guarantee the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) will raise rates at their next meeting , which will be held in March 2016 . This will depend on how the labor market performs as well as inflation levels .

# ::tok Certain kinds of people have always been drawn to the wilds of Alaska . The kind who want to live a rugged , self - reliant existence . The kind that are willing to work hard for what they need to survive . And the kind who don’t mind being away from society and civilization for long stretches of time . There’s something about the vast wilderness that is undeniably alluring to certain types . It was the reason for the Klondike gold rush in the late 1800 s . It was the reason why homesteaders moved there in droves in the early 20th century . And it’s the reason why a lot of people still move there today .

Now , scientists have discovered that this bizarre cancer has been spreading among mollusks for more than two centuries . And , according to new research published today ( April 24 ) in the journal Nature , the disease may be caused by a virus carried by sea birds .

# ::tok When was the last time you heard someone say that they were going to take a shower ? I don’t mean that they needed a shower or wanted to take one , but that they actually said that they were taking one . In fact , the last time I can remember someone saying this to me was when I was in high school . One of my friends came over and said , " I need to go home and take a shower . ” That was it . There wasn’t any more context to his statement . I just took him at his word . He went home , he took a shower , and then he returned to my house .
