# ::tok As unthinkable as it now seems , the role of John Shaft , paragon of movie star Black masculinity , was very nearly cast as a white character . Executives at Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer wanted to flip the source material — a 1970 novel about a Black private detective — for white audiences . But the director Gordon Parks’s vision for the treatment convinced the studio to cast in the role the model and actor Richard Roundtree , who died Tuesday at 81 .

Insurance , for example , is not only inedible but intangible . It is a resource that customers hope never to need , a product that functions somewhat like a tax on fear .

# ::tok Outside the tiny town of Simon in Romania’s Carpathian Mountains , an NGO called Foundation Conservation Carpathia is creating a 66,000 - acre national park . It’s against that backdrop that the hotelier Bogdan Calulanu opened Matca , a 16 - room hotel with 10 private villas . Matca is the Romanian word for " queen bee , ” the name a reference to the beekeeping practiced in this honey - producing corner of Transylvania and also to the pastoral serenity of a region that’s barely changed since the Middle Ages .

# ::tok I’ve become a real kvetch . I have lived in the same neighborhood , in Brooklyn , for the better part of the past decade , spending the last five years in a hand - me - down apartment from a friend . One day I recognized where I lived ; the next , I didn’ t. Overnight , gaggles of 20 - somethings began to roam the streets , presumably in search of eyebrows , which none of them seemed to have . Rent became obscene . I’d find myself the only Black person standing on the corner , waiting for the light to change . New high - rises as elegant as Lego blocks appeared on what seemed like every other street . Passive - aggressive notes from new residents started popping up in my lobby . One night , I came home to a can of alcoholic seltzer on top of my mailbox .

# ::tok On Nov. 1 , the American Ornithological Society announced that it would be renaming all the birds under its purview that are currently named for human beings . The birds’ new names will reflect the species’ appearance or habitat — some trait associated with the actual bird , in other words , and not with the colonial explorer who first identified it .

# ::tok Early in September , when the social media star Logan Paul and the mixed - marti al-arts welterweight Dillon Danis sat down for an interview in advance of their Oct. 14 boxing match , they seemed less like professional athletes and more like high school bullies vying to supplant each other in popularity . It wasn’t just the mini - mullets or the cocky schoolboy grins ; it was the second - rate insults and personal attacks that ping - ponged back and forth . " Mr. Mumble - Jumble - Stumble his way through a sentence , ” Paul taunted when Danis tripped over his words . Danis repeated , ad nauseam , " You’re a scumbag , bro . ” " The hate between these two is real , ” DAZN , the streaming service set to air the fight , declared . This was the central narrative promoting the match . In lieu of top talent or actual competitive stakes , things began with Danis and Paul’s celebrity and operatic rivalry : Maybe that would attract hundreds of thousands of viewers and tens of millions of dollars to an otherwise middling boxing match .

# ::tok Since taking over the Heritage Foundation in 2021 , Kevin D. Roberts has been making his mark on an institution that came to prominence during the Reagan years and has long been seen as an incubator of conservative policy and thought . Roberts , who was not well known outside policy circles when he took over , has pushed the think tank away from its hawkish roots by arguing against funding the war in Ukraine , a turnabout that prompted some of Heritage’s policy analysts to leave . Now he’s looking ahead , to the 2024 election and beyond . Roberts told me that he views Heritage’s role today as " institutionalizing Trumpism . ” This includes leading Project 2025 , a transition blueprint that outlines a plan to consolidate power in the executive branch , dismantle federal agencies and recruit and vet government employees to free the next Republican president from a system that Roberts views as stacked against conservative power . The lesson of Trump’s first year in office , Roberts told me , is that " the Trump administration , with the best of intentions , simply got a slow start . And Heritage and our allies in Project 2025 believe that must never be repeated . ”

# ::tok Since Claudine Gay’s resignation as president of Harvard University on Tuesday , it has become an article of faith among some of her supporters and other observers that she was targeted , criticized and essentially driven from the job largely because of her race . The idea is that the people who questioned her abilities and academic integrity — be they Harvard donors who found fault with her leadership after Oct. 7 or conservative activists who led an inquiry into plagiarism in her scholarly work — were marked and even motivated by animus toward a Black woman attaining such a degree of power and influence .

# ::tok Good graphic novels tend to appear in bookstores seemingly out of nowhere after years of rumors , scattershot serialization , " process” zines and snippets posted to social media . As literature , long - form comics are uniquely resistant to editing . As visual art , the cartoonist is in the weird position of having no access to the final product until it’s presented to the public . So it’s frankly miraculous when we get as many good comics as we do . This year there were remarkable new books from established masters and freshman graphic novels from brilliant young artists . Better still , a gratifyingly thick stratum of our 2023 stack was devoted to making us laugh . It’s a rich conversation , and one that promises to continue into next year and long beyond .

# ::tok Manchester is a city of glory and grit . Set among the damp northwest hills of England , it’s the rain - spattered home of Northern soul and legendary bands like Joy Division , New Order and Oasis ; two world famous soccer clubs ; the cradle of the industrial revolution ; and one of the most vibrant nightlife scenes on the planet . Style and swagger ? This proud city has them in spades . But most people would not consider it a capital of high fashion .

# ::tok My morning routine is how I set myself up for the day . I splash my face with water and will often use Oskia’s Super C Beauty Capsules . I’m a big fan of Augustinus Bader’s The Light Cream and then Merit’s Great Skin Instant Glow Serum , which is very subtle . I’m really into their makeup : they have this Bronze Balm in a stick and blushers that come in little jars that are easy to swipe on . I use RMS UnCoverup Concealer and Supergoop Glowscreen SPF 40 . I have an orangy red lipstick from NARS called Heatwave that I’ll wear here and there . I was on a shoot recently and the makeup artist told me about using this Schwarzkopf Styling Gel on your brows — it’s the only thing that actually stays for me . Kure nail varnish has the best range of colors and is the most durable of all the natural products ; I like Rose Milk .

# ::tok When the Moroccan financier Aziz Nahas decided to buy and regenerate a farm outside Marrakesh about two decades ago , he underestimated how much would grow there . Now , the 10 - acre plot produces organic vegetables and fruits as well as hosting an artist residency program and a ceramic studio , all under the name Sanctuary Slimane . In 2021 , Nahas’s friend the French restaurateur Benjamin Pastor suggested they partner up to start a cafe and farm shop in the busy Marrakesh neighborhood of Gueliz . Last spring , they opened the coffee shop Blue Ribbon , with offerings including fresh salads served with halloumi or beets and almonds and a bánh mí sandwich on fresh sourdough . In the fall , they added a seating area next door and the Slimane Farm Shop , which sells vegetables and products like honey and dried herbs that are grown and produced on the farm . Up next : Farmers , a restaurant headed by Blue Ribbon’s chef and located in the same building . The 46 - seat space , lined with colorful Popham tiles , is scheduled to open at the end of February . blueribbonmarrakech . com .

# ::tok SATURDAY PUZZLE — What did Simeon Seigel do to us here in his debut Saturday construction ? Maybe it’s no coincidence that he has mainly specialized in Thursday grids . This puzzle includes eight unchecked squares , typically a crossword no - no. Each of them sports a circle , which indicates some sort of theme , which is typically a Saturday no - no. Oh , and every black square in the entire grid is disconnected from every other black square , even on the diagonal , which is typically , well … considered impossible ? Rarer than rare , perhaps .

# ::tok " Do questions or answers create history ? ” Terrance Hayes asks in WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE : Visual and Literary Reflections on a Century of American Poetry ( Penguin , 214 pp . , paperback , $20 ) , a new book of essays , illustrations and prose experiments released simultaneously with a collection of poems , SO TO SPEAK ( Penguin Poets , 90 pp . , paperback , $20 ) . The question is No. 199 in a list of 255 that appear beside a timeline of 20th - century events interspersed throughout the book . These events were important either for history ( 1929 : " Stock market crash” ) or for poetry ( 1930 : " Hart Crane publishes ‘The Bridge’” ) — or do these come to the same thing ?

# ::tok When Scotty Scott was about 8 years old , his aunt Yvonne made him stem pounds and pounds of green beans for a big holiday dinner . Young Scotty figured that if he intentionally left on some of the ends and kept most of the pods long and floppy — in other words , did a bad job — he’d never again be tasked with such an arduous responsibility . But Aunt Yvonne caught on quickly . " What are you doing , man ? ” she asked when she saw his pile of odds and ends . " No , no , no , no — get back in there ! You know how to snap beans . ”

# ::tok It’s been just over two weeks since the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies Donald Trump from holding the office of president of the United States , and I spent way too much of my holiday vacation reading the legal and political commentary around the decision , and as I did so , I found myself experiencing déjà vu . Since the rise of Trump , he and his movement have transgressed constitutional , legal and moral boundaries at will and then , when Americans attempt to impose consequences for those transgressions , Trump’s defenders and critics alike caution that the consequences will be dangerous or destabilizing .

# ::tok In 1996 , in a phrase that’s stuck with me , Richard John Neuhaus described the Holocaust as " our only culturally available icon of absolute evil . ” The line appeared in a critical review of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen’s best - selling and furor - starting book , " Hitler’s Willing Executioners , ” which was itself an example of Neuhaus’s point in action . In the post - Cold War landscape , with American power seemingly occupying the stage of history by itself , the memory of Nazi Germany’s genocide came to play a special cultural role in the self - understanding of the liberal West : We might not agree on the highest good , but we knew the highest evil , and arguments about its memory and meaning and implications were absolutely central to politics and culture .

# ::tok The oeuvre of director Norman Jewison , who died this past weekend at the age of 97 , can’t be simply categorized . His versatility was rarely matched by any of his peers . He made epic musicals like " Fiddler on the Roof , ” heart - stirring romantic comedies like " Moonstruck” and tense social thrillers like " In the Heat of the Night . ” Over his decades in Hollywood , he directed everything from the Cold War comedy " The Russians Are Coming , the Russians Are Coming” ( 1966 ) to the sexy heist feature " The Thomas Crown Affair” ( 1968 ) to the based - on - a - true - story drama " The Hurricane” ( 1999 ) . While the divergent tones could imply that Jewison was something of a journeyman , instead he brought a humanity to every story he touched , treating each one , regardless of subject matter , with the grace it deserved . Here are some films of his available to stream , no matter your mood .

# ::tok I’m a nearly 70 - year - old single mother living with an adult son of 40 who has schizoaffective disorder , which is a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar conditions . I testified at a juried trial that for over 10 years he has been averse to staying on antipsychotic meds , and that , as a result , he has been jailed , and that he has attacked me repeatedly in outbursts of rage . But two of 12 jurors didn’t agree that my son should be obliged to stay on meds . As a result , he has just been released from a medication mandate . Now , for the umpteenth time , distant family members are urging me to boot my mentally disabled son out of the apartment we share .

# ::tok Davis Polk , one of the country’s most prestigious law firms , recently rescinded employment offers made to three students who the firm believed led organizations at Harvard and Columbia that issued statements blaming Israel for the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that left more than 1,400 Israelis dead . On Tuesday , the firm said it was reconsidering that decision for two of the three students , who fought their dismissals and said they had not authorized the letters , which did not have any individual signatories . The potential reversal highlights the complexities — for both employers and employees — of navigating what has quickly become one of the most emotionally divisive issues in recent decades .

# ::tok For several weeks this past autumn , a fashionably dressed woman could be seen in the window of a London art gallery stooping to pick up a half - dozen designer shopping bags . A digital print on a mirror made by the artist Sylvie Fleury , the woman was permanently frozen in the act , her bare midriff impervious to the rain outside . A collection of real bags on the floor before her doubled the optical illusion for passers - by , who might have been carrying their own bags from the nearby Versace or Dolce & Gabbana stores . But the gallery , Sprüth Magers , is not the kind of place where most people can casually drop in and buy something ; the artworks sold there fetch prices in the tens to the hundreds of thousands . If Fleury’s work poked fun at the view that art is just a commodity , it was also a nostalgic reflection on the moment the empty shopping bags were first shown by the gallery , in 1991 — a time when neither she nor her dealers could have afforded a permanent storefront in Mayfair .

# ::tok Over the past few years , hundreds of families and school districts around the country have sued big tech companies on the grounds that the hypnotic properties of social media popular with children have left too many of them unwell . Citing the promotion of the " corpse bride” diet , for example , and other practices around dangerous forms of weight loss , Seattle Public Schools filed a complaint in January arguing that platforms like TikTok and Snapchat have been so unsparing in their delivery of harmful material to students that the resulting anxiety , depression and suicidal ideation were interfering with the school system’s primary mission of educating children .

# ::tok Americans complain that inflation has eroded the value of their money , but the U.S. dollar looks lovely to the people of Argentina , where consumer prices rose 124 percent in August from a year earlier . The threat of hyperinflation has become a central issue in the presidential election on Oct. 22 , which The Times has described as " a new test of the strength of the far right around the world . ” The leading candidate in the race , which could go to a November runoff , is a radical libertarian who promises to bring rising prices under control by getting rid of the peso and fully dollarizing the Argentine economy .

# ::tok Which country has the best education system ? Since 2000 , every three years , 15 - year - olds in dozens of countries have taken the Program for International Student Assessment — a standardized test of math , reading and science skills . On the inaugural test , which focused on reading , the top country came as a big surprise : tiny Finland . Finnish students claimed victory again in 2003 ( when the focus was on math ) and 2006 ( when it was on science ) , all while spending about the same time on homework per week as the typical teenager in Shanghai does in a single day .

# ::tok Some new restaurants are opportunistic , the result of circumstance . Others , like the Danish chef Mads Refslund’s new Brooklyn project , are years in the planning — eight years exactly , said Mr. Refslund , a founder of Noma in Copenhagen . What he set out to achieve is a fluid fine - dining concept , where the cooks are the servers . " Everyone is a cook , ” he said . " They can best explain the food to the customers , but turning cooks into waiters is a challenge . ” There are 26 of them , all dressed in black and rotating their stations . They’re in full view at work : The dining room amounts to a huge square kitchen , surrounded by 58 counter and table seats , and a bar and a lounge in an industrial space — previously a rubber factory — with a white brick 1930 s facade . The restaurant’s menu lists ingredients , each of which can be ordered , in consultation with a cook / waiter , hot or cold , grilled or chilled , or , as the name has it , fire ( ild in Danish ) and ice ( is ) . The only meat options are sustainable American bison and venison . Custom carts bearing produce and seafood snacks to start a meal ( priced per item ) patrol the dining area . The menu is à la carte with a minimum of five dishes per person ( $ 150 ) ; some are served family - style . The 18 - seat bar also serves food with no minimum requirement . Among the dishes devised by Mr. Refslund and Bryce Shuman , his chef de cuisine ( who knows his way around a grill if his food at Sweetbriar , his previous gig , is any indication ) , are Shigoku oysters with green almonds and cucumber , venison tartare wrapped in beet rosettes , tuna lightly roasted on kombu , grilled wild duck with plum juice , grilled sea scallop dumplings , surf clam shells sealed to form a vessel and filled with clam and tomato water to drink , and smoked barbecued eel . On Sundays , meals are served family style , starting at noon , no reservations . ( Opens Wednesday )
