The restaurant\u2019s menu lists ingredients , each of which can be ordered , in consultation with a cook / waiter , hot or cold , grilled or chilled , or , as the name has it , fire ( ild in Danish ) and ice ( is ) . The only meat options are sustainable American bison and venison . Custom carts bearing produce and seafood snacks to start a meal ( priced per item ) patrol the dining area . The menu is \u00e0 la carte with a minimum of five dishes per person ( $ 150 ) ; some are served family - style . The 18 - seat bar also serves food with no minimum requirement . Among the dishes devised by Mr. Refslund and Bryce Shuman , his chef de cuisine ( who knows his way around a grill if his food at Sweetbriar , his previous gig , is any indication ) , are Shigoku oysters with green almonds and cucumber , venison tartare wrapped in beet rosettes , tuna lightly roasted on kombu , grilled wild duck with plum juice , grilled sea scallop dumplings , surf clam shells sealed to form a vessel and filled with clam and tomato water to drink , and smoked barbecued eel . On Sundays , meals are served family style , starting at noon , no reservations .
