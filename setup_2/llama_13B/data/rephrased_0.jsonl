Using a combination of machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data, an algorithm has been created that can accurately predict what kind of content will go viral online before it even happens. A company is born to capitalize on this technology by creating a platform where people can post their own \u201cviral\u201d video content for free, in exchange for sharing their personal data with the corporation. As a result, the platform becomes so popular that it quickly replaces traditional social media as the primary method of communication between users. The company makes billions, and all the other social media platforms slowly die out or are acquired by the new giant."}
